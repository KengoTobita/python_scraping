Over\\nthe main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE,\\nand, in a shield, the World State\\'s motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.\\n\\nThe enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for\\nall the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself,\\na harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped\\nlay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the\\nglass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness\\nresponded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands\\ngloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a\\nghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain\\nrich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak\\nafter luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.\\n\\n\\n\"And this,\" said the Director opening the door, \"is the Fertilizing Room.\"\\n\\n\\nBent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as\\nthe Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely\\nbreathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of\\nabsorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink\\nand callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director\\'s heels. Each\\nof them carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he\\ndesperately scribbled. Straight from the horse\\'s mouth. It was a rare\\nprivilege. The D. H. C. for Central London always made a point of personally\\nconducting his new students round the various departments.\\n\\n\\n\"Just to give you a general idea,\" he would explain to them. For of course\\nsome sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work\\nintelligently–though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy\\nmembers of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for\\nvirtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not\\nphilosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of\\nsociety.\\n\\n\\n\"To-morrow,\" he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing\\ngeniality, \"you\\'ll be settling down to serious work. You won\\'t have time for\\ngeneralities. Meanwhile …\"\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse\\'s mouth into the\\nnotebook. The boys scribbled like mad.\\n\\n\\nTall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. He\\nhad a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not\\ntalking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? Fifty?\\nFifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn\\'t arise; in this\\nyear of stability, A. F. 632, it didn\\'t occur to you to ask it.\\n\\n\\n\"I shall begin at the beginning,\" said the D.H.C. and the more zealous\\nstudents recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the\\nbeginning. \"These,\" he waved his hand, \"are the incubators.\" And opening\\nan insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test-tubes. \"The\\nweek\\'s supply of ova. Kept,\" he explained, \"at blood heat; whereas the male\\ngametes,\" and here he opened another door, \"they have to be kept at\\nthirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes.\" Rams wrapped\\nin theremogene beget no lambs.\\n\\n\\nStill leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils\\nscurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern\\nfertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction–\"the\\noperation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the\\nfact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months\\' salary\"; continued with\\nsome account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and\\nactively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature,\\nsalinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened\\neggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed\\nthem how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out\\ndrop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs\\nwhich it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred\\nto a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this\\nreceptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming\\nspermatozoa–at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic\\ncentimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted\\nout of the liquor and its contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs\\nremained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again;\\nhow the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas\\nremained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were\\nbrought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky\\'s\\nProcess.\\n\\n\\n\"Bokanovsky\\'s Process,\" repeated the Director, and the students underlined\\nthe words in their little notebooks.\\n\\n\\nOne egg, one embryo, one adult-normality. But a bokanovskified egg will\\nbud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and every\\nbud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a\\nfull-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew\\nbefore. Progress.\\n\\n\\n\"Essentially,\" the D.H.C. concluded, \"bokanovskification consists of a\\nseries of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and,\\nparadoxically enough, the egg responds by budding.\"\\n\\n\\nResponds by budding. The pencils were busy.\\n\\n\\nHe pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was\\nentering a large metal box, another, rack-full was emerging. Machinery faintly\\npurred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight\\nminutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of\\nthe rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some\\neight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop;\\nthen, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four,\\neight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to\\ndeath with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded–bud out of\\nbud out of bud–were thereafter–further arrest being generally fatal–left to\\ndevelop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming\\nanything from eight to ninety-six embryos– a prodigious improvement, you will\\nagree, on nature. Identical twins–but not in piddling twos and threes as in\\nthe old viviparous days, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide;\\nactually by dozens, by scores at a time.\\n\\n\\n\"Scores,\" the Director repeated and flung out his arms, as though he were\\ndistributing largesse. \"Scores.\"\\n\\n\\nBut one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay.\\n\\n\\n\"My good boy!\" The Director wheeled sharply round on him. \"Can\\'t you see?\\nCan\\'t you see?\" He raised a hand; his expression was solemn. \"Bokanovsky\\'s\\nProcess is one of the major instruments of social stability!\"\\n\\n\\nMajor instruments of social stability.\\n\\n\\nStandard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory\\nstaffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg.\\n\\n\\n\"Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!\" The\\nvoice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. \"You really know where you are.\\nFor the first time in history.\" He quoted the planetary motto. \"Community,\\nIdentity, Stability.\" Grand words. \"If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the\\nwhole problem would be solved.\"\\n\\n\\nSolved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Millions of\\nidentical twins. The principle of mass production at last applied to biology.\\n\\n\\n\"But, alas,\" the Director shook his head, \"we can\\'t bokanovskify\\nindefinitely.\"\\n\\n\\nNinety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average. From the\\nsame ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of\\nidentical twins as possible–that was the best (sadly a second best) that they\\ncould do. And even that was difficult.\\n\\n\\n\"For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach\\nmaturity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here\\nand now. Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century–what would be the use\\nof that?\"\\n\\n\\nObviously, no use at all. But Podsnap\\'s Technique had immensely\\naccelerated the process of ripening. They could make sure of at least a\\nhundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. Fertilize and bokanovskify–in\\nother words, multiply by seventy-two–and you get an average of nearly eleven\\nthousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical\\ntwins, all within two years of the same age.\\n\\n\\n\"And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen\\nthousand adult individuals.\"\\n\\n\\nBeckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be passing at\\nthe moment. \"Mr. Foster,\" he called. The ruddy young man approached. \"Can you\\ntell us the record for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?\"\\n\\n\"Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre,\" Mr. Foster replied without\\nhesitation. He spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and took an\\nevident pleasure in quoting figures. \"Sixteen thousand and twelve; in one\\nhundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. But of course they\\'ve done much\\nbetter,\" he rattled on, \"in some of the tropical Centres. Singapore has often\\nproduced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and Mombasa has actually touched\\nthe seventeen thousand mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should\\nsee the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! It\\'s quite astonishing, when\\nyou\\'re used to working with European material. Still,\" he added, with a laugh\\n(but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was\\nchallenging), \"still, we mean to beat them if we can. I\\'m working on a\\nwonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment. Only just eighteen months old.\\nOver twelve thousand seven hundred children already, either decanted or in\\nembryo. And still going strong. We\\'ll beat them yet.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the spirit I like!\" cried the Director, and clapped Mr. Foster on\\nthe shoulder. \"Come along with us, and give these boys the benefit of your\\nexpert knowledge.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Foster smiled modestly. \"With pleasure.\" They went.\\n\\n\\nIn the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. Flaps\\nof fresh sow\\'s peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in\\nlittle lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement. Whizz and then, click!\\nthe lift-hatches hew open; the bottle-liner had only to reach out a hand, take\\nthe flap, insert, smooth-down, and before the lined bottle had had time to\\ntravel out of reach along the endless band, whizz, click! another flap of\\nperitoneum had shot up from the depths, ready to be slipped into yet another\\nbottle, the next of that slow interminable procession on the band.\\n\\n\\nNext to the Liners stood the Matriculators. The procession advanced; one\\nby one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the larger\\ncontainers; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit, the morula dropped into\\nplace, the saline solution poured in … and already the bottle had passed, and\\nit was the turn of the labellers. Heredity, date of fertilization, membership\\nof Bokanovsky Group–details were transferred from test-tube to bottle. No\\nlonger anonymous, but named, identified, the procession marched slowly on; on\\nthrough an opening in the wall, slowly on into the Social Predestination Room.\\n\\n\\n\"Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index,\" said Mr. Foster with relish, as\\nthey entered.\\n\\n\\n\"Containing all the relevant information,\" added the Director.\\n\\n\\n\"Brought up to date every morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And co-ordinated every afternoon.\"\\n\\n\\n\"On the basis of which they make their calculations.\"\\n\\n\\n\"So many individuals, of such and such quality,\" said Mr. Foster.\\n\\n\\n\"Distributed in such and such quantities.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The optimum Decanting Rate at any given moment.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Unforeseen wastages promptly made good.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Promptly,\" repeated Mr. Foster. \"If you knew the amount of overtime I had\\nto put in after the last Japanese earthquake!\" He laughed goodhumouredly and\\nshook his head.\\n\\n\\n\"The Predestinators send in their figures to the Fertilizers.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Who give them the embryos they ask for.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail.\"\\n\\n\\n\"After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Where we now proceed ourselves.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd opening a door Mr. Foster led the way down a staircase into the\\nbasement.\\n\\n\\nThe temperature was still tropical. They descended into a thickening\\ntwilight. Two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar\\nagainst any possible infiltration of the day.\\n\\n\\n\"Embryos are like photograph film,\" said Mr. Foster waggishly, as he\\npushed open the second door. \"They can only stand red light.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him\\nwas visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer\\'s\\nafternoon. The bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of\\nbottles glinted with innumerable rubies, and among the rubies moved the dim\\nred spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus.\\nThe hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air.\\n\\n\\n\"Give them a few figures, Mr. Foster,\" said the Director, who was tired of\\ntalking.\\n\\n\\nMr. Foster was only too happy to give them a few figures.\\n\\n\\nTwo hundred and twenty metres long, two hundred wide, ten high. He pointed\\nupwards. Like chickens drinking, the students lifted their eyes towards the\\ndistant ceiling.\\n\\n\\nThree tiers of racks: ground floor level, first gallery, second gallery.\\n\\n\\nThe spidery steel-work of gallery above gallery faded away in all\\ndirections into the dark. Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading\\ndemijohns from a moving staircase.\\n\\n\\nThe escalator from the Social Predestination Room.\\n\\n\\nEach bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks, each rack, though you\\ncouldn\\'t see it, was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty-three and a\\nthird centimetres an hour. Two hundred and sixty-seven days at eight metres a\\nday. Two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in all. One circuit of the\\ncellar at ground level, one on the first gallery, half on the second, and on\\nthe two hundred and sixty-seventh morning, daylight in the Decanting Room.\\nIndependent existence–so called.\\n\\n\\n\"But in the interval,\" Mr. Foster concluded, \"we\\'ve managed to do a lot to\\nthem. Oh, a very great deal.\" His laugh was knowing and triumphant.\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the spirit I like,\" said the Director once more. \"Let\\'s walk\\naround. You tell them everything, Mr. Foster.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Foster duly told them.\\n\\n\\nTold them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. Made them taste\\nthe rich blood surrogate on which it fed. Explained why it had to be\\nstimulated with placentin and thyroxin. Told them of the corpus luteum\\nextract. Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero\\nto 2040 it was automatically injected. Spoke of those gradually increasing\\ndoses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their\\ncourse. Described the artificial maternal circulation installed in every\\nbottle at Metre 112; showed them the reservoir of blood-surrogate, the\\ncentrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it\\nthrough the synthetic lung and waste product filter. Referred to the embryo\\'s\\ntroublesome tendency to anæmia, to the massive doses of hog\\'s stomach extract\\nand foetal foal\\'s liver with which, in consequence, it had to be supplied.\\n\\n\\nShowed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during the last two\\nmetres out of every eight, all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into\\nfamiliarity with movement. Hinted at the gravity of the so-called \"trauma of\\ndecanting,\" and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a suitable\\ntraining of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. Told them of the test\\nfor sex carried out in the neighborhood of Metre 200. Explained the system of\\nlabelling–a T for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were\\ndestined to become freemartins a question mark, black on a white ground.\\n\\n\\n\"For of course,\" said Mr. Foster, \"in the vast majority of cases,\\nfertility is merely a nuisance. One fertile ovary in twelve hundred–that would\\nreally be quite sufficient for our purposes. But we want to have a good\\nchoice. And of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety. So we\\nallow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally.\\nThe others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the\\nrest of the course. Result: they\\'re decanted as freemartins–structurally quite\\nnormal (except,\" he had to admit, \"that they do have the slightest tendency to\\ngrow beards), but sterile. Guaranteed sterile. Which brings us at last,\"\\ncontinued Mr. Foster, \"out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature\\ninto the much more interesting world of human invention.\"\\n\\n\\nHe rubbed his hands. For of course, they didn\\'t content themselves with\\nmerely hatching out embryos: any cow could do that.\\n\\n\\n\"We also predestine and condition. We decant our babies as socialized\\nhuman beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future …\" He\\nwas going to say \"future World controllers,\" but correcting himself, said\\n\"future Directors of Hatcheries,\" instead.\\n\\n\\nThe D.H.C. acknowledged the compliment with a smile.\\n\\n\\nThey were passing Metre 320 on Rack 11. A young Beta-Minus mechanic was\\nbusy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing\\nbottle. The hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he\\nturned the nuts. Down, down … A final twist, a glance at the revolution\\ncounter, and he was done. He moved two paces down the line and began the same\\nprocess on the next pump.\\n\\n\\n\"Reducing the number of revolutions per minute,\" Mr. Foster explained.\\n\"The surrogate goes round slower; therefore passes through the lung at longer\\nintervals; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. Nothing like\\noxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par.\" Again he rubbed his hands.\\n\\n\\n\"But why do you want to keep the embryo below par?\" asked an ingenuous\\nstudent.\\n\\n\\n\"Ass!\" said the Director, breaking a long silence. \"Hasn\\'t it occurred to\\nyou that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an\\nEpsilon heredity?\"\\n\\n\\nIt evidently hadn\\'t occurred to him. He was covered with confusion.\\n\\n\\n\"The lower the caste,\" said Mr. Foster, \"the shorter the oxygen.\" The\\nfirst organ affected was the brain. After that the skeleton. At seventy per\\ncent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. At less than seventy eyeless monsters.\\n\\n\\n\"Who are no use at all,\" concluded Mr. Foster.\\n\\n\\nWhereas (his voice became confidential and eager), if they could discover\\na technique for shortening the period of maturation what a triumph, what a\\nbenefaction to Society!\\n\\n\\n\"Consider the horse.\"\\n\\n\\nThey considered it.\\n\\n\\nMature at six; the elephant at ten. While at thirteen a man is not yet\\nsexually mature; and is only full-grown at twenty. Hence, of course, that\\nfruit of delayed development, the human intelligence.\\n\\n\\n\"But in Epsilons,\" said Mr. Foster very justly, \"we don\\'t need human\\nintelligence.\"\\n\\n\\nDidn\\'t need and didn\\'t get it. But though the Epsilon mind was mature at\\nten, the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. Long years of\\nsuperfluous and wasted immaturity. If the physical development could be\\nspeeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow\\'s, what an enormous saving to\\nthe Community!\\n\\n\\n\"Enormous!\" murmured the students. Mr. Foster\\'s enthusiasm was infectious.\\n\\n\\nHe became rather technical; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co-ordination\\nwhich made men grow so slowly; postulated a germinal mutation to account for\\nit. Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone? Could the\\nindividual Epsilon embryo be made a revert, by a suitable technique, to the\\nnormality of dogs and cows? That was the problem. And it was all but solved.\\n\\n\\nPilkington, at Mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature\\nat four and full-grown at six and a half. A scientific triumph. But socially\\nuseless. Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work.\\nAnd the process was an all-or-nothing one; either you failed to modify at all,\\nor else you modified the whole way. They were still trying to find the ideal\\ncompromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. So far without success.\\nMr. Foster sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n\\nTheir wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the\\nneighborhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9. From this point onwards Rack 9 was\\nenclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of\\ntunnel, interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide.\\n\\n\\n\"Heat conditioning,\" said Mr. Foster.\\n\\n\\nHot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. Coolness was wedded to\\ndiscomfort in the form of hard X-rays. By the time they were decanted the\\nembryos had a horror of cold. They were predestined to emigrate to the\\ntropics, to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. Later on\\ntheir minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies. \"We\\ncondition them to thrive on heat,\" concluded Mr. Foster. \"Our colleagues\\nupstairs will teach them to love it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And that,\" put in the Director sententiously, \"that is the secret of\\nhappiness and virtue–liking what you\\'ve got to do. All conditioning aims at\\nthat: making people like their unescapable social destiny.\"\\n\\n\\nIn a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a long\\nfine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. The students\\nand their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Lenina,\" said Mr. Foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and\\nstraightened herself up.\\n\\n\\nThe girl turned with a start. One could see that, for all the lupus and\\nthe purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty.\\n\\n\\n\"Henry!\" Her smile flashed redly at him–a row of coral teeth.\\n\\n\\n\"Charming, charming,\" murmured the Director and, giving her two or three\\nlittle pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself.\\n\\n\\n\"What are you giving them?\" asked Mr. Foster, making his tone very\\nprofessional.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Tropical workers start being inoculated at Metre 150,\" Mr. Foster\\nexplained to the students. \"The embryos still have gills. We immunize the fish\\nagainst the future man\\'s diseases.\" Then, turning back to Lenina, \"Ten to five\\non the roof this afternoon,\" he said, \"as usual.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Charming,\" said the Director once more, and, with a final pat, moved away\\nafter the others.\\n\\n\\nOn Rack 10 rows of next generation\\'s chemical workers were being trained\\nin the toleration of lead, caustic soda, tar, chlorine. The first of a batch\\nof two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the\\neleven hundred metre mark on Rack 3. A special mechanism kept their containers\\nin constant rotation. \"To improve their sense of balance,\" Mr. Foster\\nexplained. \"Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish\\njob. We slacken off the circulation when they\\'re right way up, so that they\\'re\\nhalf starved, and double the flow of surrogate when they\\'re upside down. They\\nlearn to associate topsy-turvydom with well-being; in fact, they\\'re only truly\\nhappy when they\\'re standing on their heads.\\n\\n\\n\"And now,\" Mr. Foster went on, \"I\\'d like to show you some very interesting\\nconditioning for Alpha Plus Intellectuals. We have a big batch of them on Rack\\n5. First Gallery level,\" he called to two boys who had started to go down to\\nthe ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re round about Metre 900,\" he explained. \"You can\\'t really do any\\nuseful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails.\\nFollow me.\"\\n\\n\\nBut the Director had looked at his watch. \"Ten to three,\" he said. \"No\\ntime for the intellectual embryos, I\\'m afraid. We must go up to the Nurseries\\nbefore the children have finished their afternoon sleep.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Foster was disappointed. \"At least one glance at the Decanting Room,\"\\nhe pleaded.\\n\\n\\n\"Very well then.\" The Director smiled indulgently. \"Just one glance.\"\\n\\n\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\nBrave New World (movie; 1980 BBC TV adaptation)\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

FOSTER was left in the\\nDecanting Room. The D.H.C. and his students stepped into the nearest lift and\\nwere carried up to the fifth floor.\\n\\nINFANT NURSERIES. NEO-PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING ROOMS, announced the notice\\nboard.\\n\\n\\nThe Director opened a door. They were in a large bare room, very bright\\nand sunny; for the whole of the southern wall was a single window. Half a\\ndozen nurses, trousered and jacketed in the regulation white viscose-linen\\nuniform, their hair aseptically hidden under white caps, were engaged in\\nsetting out bowls of roses in a long row across the floor. Big bowls, packed\\ntight with blossom. Thousands of petals, ripe-blown and silkily smooth, like\\nthe cheeks of innumerable little cherubs, but of cherubs, in that bright\\nlight, not exclusively pink and Aryan, but also luminously Chinese, also\\nMexican, also apoplectic with too much blowing of celestial trumpets, also\\npale as death, pale with the posthumous whiteness of marble.\\n\\n\\nThe nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in.\\n\\n\\n\"Set out the books,\" he said curtly.\\n\\n\\nIn silence the nurses obeyed his command. Between the rose bowls the books\\nwere duly set out–a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some\\ngaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird.\\n\\n\\n\"Now bring in the children.\"\\n\\n\\nThey hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing\\na kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with\\neight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident)\\nand all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki.\\n\\n\\n\"Put them down on the floor.\"\\n\\n\\nThe infants were unloaded.\\n\\n\\n\"Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books.\"\\n\\n\\nTurned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those\\nclusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white\\npages. As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a\\ncloud. The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; a new\\nand profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books.\\nFrom the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement,\\ngurgles and twitterings of pleasure.\\n\\n\\nThe Director rubbed his hands. \"Excellent!\" he said. \"It might almost have\\nbeen done on purpose.\"\\n\\n\\nThe swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. Small hands reached out\\nuncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling\\nthe illuminated pages of the books. The Director waited until all were happily\\nbusy. Then, \"Watch carefully,\" he said. And, lifting his hand, he gave the\\nsignal.\\n\\n\\nThe Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the\\nroom, pressed down a little lever.\\n\\n\\nThere was a violent explosion. Shriller and ever shriller, a siren\\nshrieked. Alarm bells maddeningly sounded.\\n\\n\\nThe children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror.\\n\\n\\n\"And now,\" the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), \"now we\\nproceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.\"\\n\\n\\nHe waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever. The\\nscreaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. There was something\\ndesperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now\\ngave utterance. Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved\\njerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.\\n\\n\\n\"We can electrify that whole strip of floor,\" bawled the Director in\\nexplanation. \"But that\\'s enough,\" he signalled to the nurse.\\n\\n\\nThe explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren\\ndied down from tone to tone into silence. The stiffly twitching bodies\\nrelaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out\\nonce more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.\\n\\n\\n\"Offer them the flowers and the books again.\"\\n\\n\\nThe nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of\\nthose gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black\\nsheep, the infants shrank away in horror, the volume of their howling suddenly\\nincreased.\\n\\n\\n\"Observe,\" said the Director triumphantly, \"observe.\"\\n\\n\\nBooks and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks–already in the infant\\nmind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred\\nrepetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. What\\nman has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'ll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an \\'instinctive\\'\\nhatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They\\'ll be safe\\nfrom books and botany all their lives.\" The Director turned to his nurses.\\n\"Take them away again.\"\\n\\n\\nStill yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and\\nwheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome\\nsilence.\\n\\n\\nOne of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well\\nwhy you couldn\\'t have lower-cast people wasting the Community\\'s time over\\nbooks, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which\\nmight undesirably decondition one of their reflexes, yet … well, he couldn\\'t\\nunderstand about the flowers. Why go to the trouble of making it\\npsychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers?\\n\\n\\nPatiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream at the\\nsight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long\\nago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been\\nconditioned to like flowers–flowers in particular and wild nature in general.\\nThe idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every\\navailable opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport.\\n\\n\\n\"And didn\\'t they consume transport?\" asked the student.\\n\\n\\n\"Quite a lot,\" the D.H.C. replied. \"But nothing else.\"\\n\\n\\nPrimroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are\\ngratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to\\nabolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish\\nthe love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of\\ncourse it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even\\nthough they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason\\nfor consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It\\nwas duly found.\\n\\n\\n\"We condition the masses to hate the country,\" concluded the Director.\\n\"But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same\\ntime, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate\\napparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport.\\nHence those electric shocks.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I see,\" said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration.\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence; then, clearing his throat, \"Once upon a time,\" the\\nDirector began, \"while our Ford was still on earth, there was a little boy\\ncalled Reuben Rabinovitch. Reuben was the child of Polish-speaking parents.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Director interrupted himself. \"You know what Polish is, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\\n\"A dead language.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Like French and German,\" added another student, officiously showing off\\nhis learning.\\n\\n\\n\"And \\'parent\\'?\" questioned the D.H.C.\\n\\n\\nThere was an uneasy silence. Several of the boys blushed. They had not yet\\nlearned to draw the significant but often very fine distinction between smut\\nand pure science. One, at last, had the courage to raise a hand.\\n\\n\\n\"Human beings used to be …\" he hesitated; the blood rushed to his cheeks.\\n\"Well, they used to be viviparous.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Quite right.\" The Director nodded approvingly.\\n\\n\\n\"And when the babies were decanted …\"\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Born,\\'\" came the correction.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, then they were the parents–I mean, not the babies, of course; the\\nother ones.\" The poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion.\\n\\n\\n\"In brief,\" the Director summed up, \"the parents were the father and the\\nmother.\" The smut that was really science fell with a crash into the boys\\'\\neye-avoiding silence. \"Mother,\" he repeated loudly rubbing in the science;\\nand, leaning back in his chair, \"These,\" he said gravely, \"are unpleasant\\nfacts; I know it. But then most historical facts are unpleasant.\"\\n\\n\\nHe returned to Little Reuben–to Little Reuben, in whose room, one evening,\\nby an oversight, his father and mother (crash, crash!) happened to leave the\\nradio turned on.\\n\\n\\n(\"For you must remember that in those days of gross viviparous\\nreproduction, children were always brought up by their parents and not in\\nState Conditioning Centres.\")\\n\\n\\nWhile the child was asleep, a broadcast programme from London suddenly\\nstarted to come through; and the next morning, to the astonishment of his\\ncrash and crash (the more daring of the boys ventured to grin at one another),\\nLittle Reuben woke up repeating word for word a long lecture by that curious\\nold writer (\"one of the very few whose works have been permitted to come down\\nto us\"), George Bernard Shaw, who was speaking, according to a\\nwell-authenticated tradition, about his own genius. To Little Reuben\\'s wink\\nand snigger, this lecture was, of course, perfectly incomprehensible and,\\nimagining that their child had suddenly gone mad, they sent for a doctor. He,\\nfortunately, understood English, recognized the discourse as that which Shaw\\nhad broadcasted the previous evening, realized the significance of what had\\nhappened, and sent a letter to the medical press about it.\\n\\n\\n\"The principle of sleep-teaching, or hypnopædia, had been discovered.\" The\\nD.H.C. made an impressive pause.\\n\\n\\nThe principle had been discovered; but many, many years were to elapse\\nbefore that principle was usefully applied.\\n\\n\\n\"The case of Little Reuben occurred only twenty-three years after Our\\nFord\\'s first T-Model was put on the market.\" (Here the Director made a sign of\\nthe T on his stomach and all the students reverently followed suit.) \"And yet\\n…\"\\n\\n\\nFuriously the students scribbled. \"Hypnopædia, first used officially in\\nA.F. 214. Why not before? Two reasons. (a) …\"\\n\\n\\n\"These early experimenters,\" the D.H.C. was saying, \"were on the wrong\\ntrack. They thought that hypnopædia could be made an instrument of\\nintellectual education …\"\\n\\n\\n(A small boy asleep on his right side, the right arm stuck out, the right\\nhand hanging limp over the edge of the bed. Through a round grating in the\\nside of a box a voice speaks softly.\\n\\n\\n\"The Nile is the longest river in Africa and the second in length of all\\nthe rivers of the globe. Although falling short of the length of the\\nMississippi-Missouri, the Nile is at the head of all rivers as regards the\\nlength of its basin, which extends through 35 degrees of latitude …\"\\n\\n\\nAt breakfast the next morning, \"Tommy,\" some one says, \"do you know which\\nis the longest river in Africa?\" A shaking of the head. \"But don\\'t you\\nremember something that begins: The Nile is the …\"\\n\\n\\n\"The - Nile - is - the - longest - river - in - Africa - and - the -\\nsecond - in - length - of - all - the - rivers - of - the - globe …\" The words\\ncome rushing out. \"Although - falling - short - of …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well now, which is the longest river in Africa?\"\\n\\n\\nThe eyes are blank. \"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But the Nile, Tommy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The - Nile - is - the - longest - river - in - Africa - and - second …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then which river is the longest, Tommy?\"\\n\\n\\nTommy burst into tears. \"I don\\'t know,\" he howls.)\\n\\n\\nThat howl, the Director made it plain, discouraged the earliest\\ninvestigators. The experiments were abandoned. No further attempt was made to\\nteach children the length of the Nile in their sleep. Quite rightly. You can\\'t\\nlearn a science unless you know what it\\'s all about.\\n\\n\\n\"Whereas, if they\\'d only started on moral education,\" said the\\nDirector, leading the way towards the door. The students followed him,\\ndesperately scribbling as they walked and all the way up in the lift. \"Moral\\neducation, which ought never, in any circumstances, to be rational.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Silence, silence,\" whispered a loud speaker as they stepped out at the\\nfourteenth floor, and \"Silence, silence,\" the trumpet mouths indefatigably\\nrepeated at intervals down every corridor. The students and even the Director\\nhimself rose automatically to the tips of their toes. They were Alphas, of\\ncourse, but even Alphas have been well conditioned. \"Silence, silence.\" All\\nthe air of the fourteenth floor was sibilant with the categorical imperative.\\n\\n\\nFifty yards of tiptoeing brought them to a door which the Director\\ncautiously opened. They stepped over the threshold into the twilight of a\\nshuttered dormitory. Eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. There was a\\nsound of light regular breathing and a continuous murmur, as of very faint\\nvoices remotely whispering.\\n\\n\\nA nurse rose as they entered and came to attention before the Director.\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the lesson this afternoon?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\"We had Elementary Sex for the first forty minutes,\" she answered. \"But\\nnow it\\'s switched over to Elementary Class Consciousness.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Director walked slowly down the long line of cots. Rosy and relaxed\\nwith sleep, eighty little boys and girls lay softly breathing. There was a\\nwhisper under every pillow. The D.H.C. halted and, bending over one of the\\nlittle beds, listened attentively.\\n\\n\\n\"Elementary Class Consciousness, did you say? Let\\'s have it repeated a\\nlittle louder by the trumpet.\"\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the room a loud speaker projected from the wall. The\\nDirector walked up to it and pressed a switch.\\n\\n\\n\"… all wear green,\" said a soft but very distinct voice, beginning in the\\nmiddle of a sentence, \"and Delta Children wear khaki. Oh no, I don\\'t want to\\nplay with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They\\'re too stupid to\\nbe able to read or write. Besides they wear black, which is such a beastly\\ncolour. I\\'m so glad I\\'m a Beta.\"\\n\\n\\nThere was a pause; then the voice began again.\\n\\n\\n\"Alpha children wear grey They work much harder than we do, because\\nthey\\'re so frightfully clever. I\\'m really awfuly glad I\\'m a Beta, because I\\ndon\\'t work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas.\\nGammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no,\\nI don\\'t want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse.\\nThey\\'re too stupid to be able …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Director pushed back the switch. The voice was silent. Only its thin\\nghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows.\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'ll have that repeated forty or fifty times more before they wake;\\nthen again on Thursday, and again on Saturday. A hundred and twenty times\\nthree times a week for thirty months. After which they go on to a more\\nadvanced lesson.\"\\n\\n\\nRoses and electric shocks, the khaki of Deltas and a whiff of\\nasafœtida–wedded indissolubly before the child can speak. But wordless\\nconditioning is crude and wholesale; cannot bring home the finer distinctions,\\ncannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour. For that there must be\\nwords, but words without reason. In brief, hypnopædia.\\n\\n\\n\"The greatest moralizing and socializing force of all time.\"\\n\\n\\nThe students took it down in their little books. Straight from the horse\\'s\\nmouth.\\n\\n\\nOnce more the Director touched the switch.\\n\\n\\n\"… so frightfully clever,\" the soft, insinuating, indefatigable voice was\\nsaying, \"I\\'m really awfully glad I\\'m a Beta, because …\"\\n\\n\\nNot so much like drops of water, though water, it is true, can wear holes\\nin the hardest granite; rather, drops of liquid sealing-wax, drops that\\nadhere, incrust, incorporate themselves with what they fall on, till finally\\nthe rock is all one scarlet blob.\\n\\n\\n\"Till at last the child\\'s mind is these suggestions, and the sum of\\nthe suggestions is the child\\'s mind. And not the child\\'s mind only. The\\nadult\\'s mind too–all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and\\ndecides–made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are our\\nsuggestions!\" The Director almost shouted in his triumph. \"Suggestions from\\nthe State.\" He banged the nearest table. \"It therefore follows …\"\\n\\n\\nA noise made him turn round.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Ford!\" he said in another tone, \"I\\'ve gone and woken the children.\"\\n\\n\\n1\\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

Naked in the\\nwarm June sunshine, six or seven hundred little boys and girls were running\\nwith shrill yells over the lawns, or playing ball games, or squatting silently\\nin twos and threes among the flowering shrubs. The roses were in bloom, two\\nnightingales soliloquized in the boskage, a cuckoo was just going out of tune\\namong the lime trees. The air was drowsy with the murmur of bees and\\nhelicopters.\\n\\nThe Director and his students stood for a short time watching a game of\\nCentrifugal Bumble-puppy. Twenty children were grouped in a circle round a\\nchrome steel tower. A ball thrown up so as to land on the platform at the top\\nof the tower rolled down into the interior, fell on a rapidly revolving disk,\\nwas hurled through one or other of the numerous apertures pierced in the\\ncylindrical casing, and had to be caught.\\n\\n\\n\"Strange,\" mused the Director, as they turned away, \"strange to think that\\neven in Our Ford\\'s day most games were played without more apparatus than a\\nball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of netting. imagine the folly\\nof allowing people to play elaborate games which do nothing whatever to\\nincrease consumption. It\\'s madness. Nowadays the Controllers won\\'t approve of\\nany new game unless it can be shown that it requires at least as much\\napparatus as the most complicated of existing games.\" He interrupted himself.\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s a charming little group,\" he said, pointing.\\n\\n\\nIn a little grassy bay between tall clumps of Mediterranean heather, two\\nchildren, a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a\\nyear older, were playing, very gravely and with all the focussed attention of\\nscientists intent on a labour of discovery, a rudimentary sexual game.\\n\\n\\n\"Charming, charming!\" the D.H.C. repeated sentimentally.\\n\\n\\n\"Charming,\" the boys politely agreed. But their smile was rather\\npatronizing. They had put aside similar childish amusements too recently to be\\nable to watch them now without a touch of contempt. Charming? but it was just\\na pair of kids fooling about; that was all. Just kids.\\n\\n\\n\"I always think,\" the Director was continuing in the same rather maudlin\\ntone, when he was interrupted by a loud boo-hooing.\\n\\n\\nFrom a neighbouring shrubbery emerged a nurse, leading by the hand a small\\nboy, who howled as he went. An anxious-looking little girl trotted at her\\nheels.\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked the Director.\\n\\n\\nThe nurse shrugged her shoulders. \"Nothing much,\" she answered. \"It\\'s just\\nthat this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordinary erotic\\nplay. I\\'d noticed it once or twice before. And now again to-day. He started\\nyelling just now …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Honestly,\" put in the anxious-looking little girl, \"I didn\\'t mean to hurt\\nhim or anything. Honestly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course you didn\\'t, dear,\" said the nurse reassuringly. \"And so,\" she\\nwent on, turning back to the Director, \"I\\'m taking him in to see the Assistant\\nSuperintendent of Psychology. Just to see if anything\\'s at all abnormal.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Quite right,\" said the Director. \"Take him in. You stay here, little\\ngirl,\" he added, as the nurse moved away with her still howling charge.\\n\"What\\'s your name?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Polly Trotsky.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And a very good name too,\" said the Director. \"Run away now and see if\\nyou can find some other little boy to play with.\"\\n\\n\\nThe child scampered off into the bushes and was lost to sight.\\n\\n\\n\"Exquisite little creature!\" said the Director, looking after her. Then,\\nturning to his students, \"What I\\'m going to tell you now,\" he said, \"may sound\\nincredible. But then, when you\\'re not accustomed to history, most facts about\\nthe past do sound incredible.\"\\n\\n\\nHe let out the amazing truth. For a very long period before the time of\\nOur Ford, and even for some generations afterwards, erotic play between\\nchildren had been regarded as abnormal (there was a roar of laughter); and not\\nonly abnormal, actually immoral (no!): and had therefore been rigorously\\nsuppressed.\\n\\n\\nA look of astonished incredulity appeared on the faces of his listeners.\\nPoor little kids not allowed to amuse themselves? They could not believe it.\\n\\n\\n\"Even adolescents,\" the D.H.C. was saying, \"even adolescents like\\nyourselves …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not possible!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Barring a little surreptitious auto-erotism and homosexuality–absolutely\\nnothing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\\n\\n\"In most cases, till they were over twenty years old.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Twenty years old?\" echoed the students in a chorus of loud disbelief.\\n\\n\\n\"Twenty,\" the Director repeated. \"I told you that you\\'d find it\\nincredible.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But what happened?\" they asked. \"What were the results?\"\\n\\n\\n\"The results were terrible.\" A deep resonant voice broke startlingly into\\nthe dialogue.\\n\\n\\nThey looked around. On the fringe of the little group stood a stranger–a\\nman of middle height, black-haired, with a hooked nose, full red lips, eyes\\nvery piercing and dark. \"Terrible,\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\nThe D.H.C. had at that moment sat down on one of the steel and rubber\\nbenches conveniently scattered through the gardens; but at the sight of the\\nstranger, he sprang to his feet and darted forward, his hand outstretched,\\nsmiling with all his teeth, effusive.\\n\\n\\n\"Controller! What an unexpected pleasure! Boys, what are you thinking of?\\nThis is the Controller; this is his fordship, Mustapha Mond.\"\\n\\n\\nIn the four thousand rooms of the Centre the four thousand electric clocks\\nsimultaneously struck four. Discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths.\\n\\n\\n\"Main Day-shift off duty. Second Day-shift take over. Main Day-shift off\\n…\"\\n\\n\\nIn the lift, on their way up to the changing rooms, Henry Foster and the\\nAssistant Director of Predestination rather pointedly turned their backs on\\nBernard Marx from the Psychology Bureau: averted themselves from that\\nunsavoury reputation.\\n\\n\\nThe faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in the\\nEmbryo Store. Shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face give place to\\nanother; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept forward with their load\\nof future men and women.\\n\\n\\nLenina Crowne walked briskly towards the door.\\n\\n\\nHis fordship Mustapha Mond! The eyes of the saluting students almost\\npopped out of their heads. Mustapha Mond! The Resident Controller for Western\\nEurope! One of the Ten World Controllers. One of the Ten … and he sat down on\\nthe bench with the D.H.C., he was going to stay, to stay, yes, and actually\\ntalk to them … straight from the horse\\'s mouth. Straight from the mouth of\\nFord himself.\\n\\n\\nTwo shrimp-brown children emerged from a neighbouring shrubbery, stared at\\nthem for a moment with large, astonished eyes, then returned to their\\namusements among the leaves.\\n\\n\\n\"You all remember,\" said the Controller, in his strong deep voice, \"you\\nall remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford\\'s:\\nHistory is bunk. History,\" he repeated slowly, \"is bunk.\"\\n\\n\\nHe waved his hand; and it was as though, with an invisible feather wisk,\\nhe had brushed away a little dust, and the dust was Harappa, was Ur of the\\nChaldees; some spider-webs, and they were Thebes and Babylon and Cnossos and\\nMycenae. Whisk. Whisk–and where was Odysseus, where was Job, where were\\nJupiter and Gotama and Jesus? Whisk–and those specks of antique dirt called\\nAthens and Rome, Jerusalem and the Middle Kingdom–all were gone. Whisk–the\\nplace where Italy had been was empty. Whisk, the cathedrals; whisk, whisk,\\nKing Lear and the Thoughts of Pascal. Whisk, Passion; whisk, Requiem; whisk,\\nSymphony; whisk …\\n\\n\\n\"Going to the Feelies this evening, Henry?\" enquired the Assistant\\nPredestinator. \"I hear the new one at the Alhambra is first-rate. There\\'s a\\nlove scene on a bearskin rug; they say it\\'s marvellous. Every hair of the bear\\nreproduced. The most amazing tactual effects.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s why you\\'re taught no history,\" the Controller was saying. \"But now\\nthe time has come …\"\\n\\n\\nThe D.H.C. looked at him nervously. There were those strange rumours of\\nold forbidden books hidden in a safe in the Controller\\'s study. Bibles,\\npoetry–Ford knew what.\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his red\\nlips twitched ironically.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, Director,\" he said in a tone of faint derision, \"I won\\'t\\ncorrupt them.\"\\n\\n\\nThe D.H.C. was overwhelmed with confusion.\\n\\n\\nThose who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. The smile on\\nBernard Marx\\'s face was contemptuous. Every hair on the bear indeed!\\n\\n\\n\"I shall make a point of going,\" said Henry Foster.\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond leaned forward, shook a finger at them. \"Just try to realize\\nit,\" he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along their\\ndiaphragms. \"Try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous mother.\"\\n\\n\\nThat smutty word again. But none of them dreamed, this time, of smiling.\\n\\n\\n\"Try to imagine what \\'living with one\\'s family\\' meant.\"\\n\\n\\nThey tried; but obviously without the smallest success.\\n\\n\\n\"And do you know what a \\'home\\' was?\"\\n\\n\\nThey shook their heads.\\n\\n\\nFrom her dim crimson cellar Lenina Crowne shot up seventeen stories,\\nturned to the right as she stepped out of the lift, walked down a long\\ncorridor and, opening the door marked GIRLS\\' DRESSING-ROOM, plunged into a\\ndeafening chaos of arms and bosoms and underclothing. Torrents of hot water\\nwere splashing into or gurgling out of a hundred baths. Rumbling and hissing,\\neighty vibro-vacuum massage machines were simultaneously kneading and sucking\\nthe firm and sunburnt flesh of eighty superb female specimens. Every one was\\ntalking at the top of her voice. A Synthetic Music machine was warbling out a\\nsuper-cornet solo.\\n\\n\\n\"Hullo, Fanny,\" said Lenina to the young woman who had the pegs and locker\\nnext to hers.\\n\\n\\nFanny worked in the Bottling Room, and her surname was also Crowne. But as\\nthe two thousand million inhabitants of the plant had only ten thousand names\\nbetween them, the coincidence was not particularly surprising.\\n\\n\\nLenina pulled at her zippers-downwards on the jacket, downwards with a\\ndouble-handed gesture at the two that held trousers, downwards again to loosen\\nher undergarment. Still wearing her shoes and stockings, she walked off\\ntowards the bathrooms.\\n\\n\\nHome, home–a few small rooms, stiflingly over-inhabited by a man, by a\\nperiodically teeming woman, by a rabble of boys and girls of all ages. No air,\\nno space; an understerilized prison; darkness, disease, and smells.\\n\\n\\n(The Controller\\'s evocation was so vivid that one of the boys, more\\nsensitive than the rest, turned pale at the mere description and was on the\\npoint of being sick.)\\n\\n\\nLenina got out of the bath, toweled herself dry, took hold of a long\\nflexible tube plugged into the wall, presented the nozzle to her breast, as\\nthough she meant to commit suicide, pressed down the trigger. A blast of\\nwarmed air dusted her with the finest talcum powder. Eight different scents\\nand eau-de-Cologne were laid on in little taps over the wash-basin. She turned\\non the third from the left, dabbed herself with chypre and, carrying her shoes\\nand stockings in her hand, went out to see if one of the vibro-vacuum machines\\nwere free.\\n\\n\\nAnd home was as squalid psychically as physically. Psychically, it was a\\nrabbit hole, a midden, hot with the frictions of tightly packed life, reeking\\nwith emotion. What suffocating intimacies, what dangerous, insane, obscene\\nrelationships between the members of the family group! Maniacally, the mother\\nbrooded over her children (her children) … brooded over them like a cat\\nover its kittens; but a cat that could talk, a cat that could say, \"My baby,\\nmy baby,\" over and over again. \"My baby, and oh, oh, at my breast, the little\\nhands, the hunger, and that unspeakable agonizing pleasure! Till at last my\\nbaby sleeps, my baby sleeps with a bubble of white milk at the corner of his\\nmouth. My little baby sleeps …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mustapha Mond, nodding his head, \"you may well shudder.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Who are you going out with to-night?\" Lenina asked, returning from the\\nvibro-vac like a pearl illuminated from within, pinkly glowing.\\n\\n\\n\"Nobody.\"\\n\\n\\nLenina raised her eyebrows in astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been feeling rather out of sorts lately,\" Fanny explained. \"Dr.\\nWells advised me to have a Pregnancy Substitute.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you\\'re only nineteen. The first Pregnancy Substitute isn\\'t\\ncompulsory till twenty-one.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I know, dear. But some people are better if they begin earlier. Dr. Wells\\ntold me that brunettes with wide pelvises, like me, ought to have their first\\nPregnancy Substitute at seventeen. So I\\'m really two years late, not two years\\nearly.\" She opened the door of her locker and pointed to the row of boxes and\\nlabelled phials on the upper shelf.\\n\\n\\n\"SYRUP OF CORPUS LUTEUM,\" Lenina read the names aloud. \"OVARIN, GUARANTEED\\nFRESH: NOT TO BE USED AFTER AUGUST 1ST, A.F. 632. MAMMARY GLAND EXTRACT: TO BE\\nTAKEN THREE TIMES DAILY, BEFORE MEALS, WITH A LITTLE WATER. PLACENTIN: 5cc TO\\nBE INJECTED INTRAVENALLY EVERY THIRD DAY … Ugh!\" Lenina shuddered. \"How I\\nloathe intravenals, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. But when they do one good …\" Fanny was a particularly sensible girl.\\n\\n\\nOur Ford–or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call\\nhimself whenever he spoke of psychological matters–Our Freud had been the\\nfirst to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. The world was full of\\nfathers–was therefore full of misery; full of mothers–therefore of every kind\\nof perversion from sadism to chastity; full of brothers, sisters, uncles,\\naunts–full of madness and suicide.\\n\\n\\n\"And yet, among the savages of Samoa, in certain islands off the coast of\\nNew Guinea …\"\\n\\n\\nThe tropical sunshine lay like warm honey on the naked bodies of children\\ntumbling promiscuously among the hibiscus blossoms. Home was in any one of\\ntwenty palm-thatched houses. In the Trobriands conception was the work of\\nancestral ghosts; nobody had ever heard of a father.\\n\\n\\n\"Extremes,\" said the Controller, \"meet. For the good reason that they were\\nmade to meet.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Wells says that a three months\\' Pregnancy Substitute now will make\\nall the difference to my health for the next three or four years.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I hope he\\'s right,\" said Lenina. \"But, Fanny, do you really mean to\\nsay that for the next three months you\\'re not supposed to …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh no, dear. Only for a week or two, that\\'s all. I shall spend the\\nevening at the Club playing Musical Bridge. I suppose you\\'re going out?\"\\n\\n\\nLenina nodded.\\n\\n\\n\"Who with?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Henry Foster.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Again?\" Fanny\\'s kind, rather moon-like face took on an incongruous\\nexpression of pained and disapproving astonishment. \"Do you mean to tell me\\nyou\\'re still going out with Henry Foster?\"\\n\\n\\nMothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. But there were also husbands,\\nwives, lovers. There were also monogamy and romance.\\n\\n\\n\"Though you probably don\\'t know what those are,\" said Mustapha Mond.\\n\\n\\nThey shook their heads.\\n\\n\\nFamily, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, a narrow channelling\\nof impulse and energy.\\n\\n\\n\"But every one belongs to every one else,\" he concluded, citing the\\nhypnopædic proverb.\\n\\n\\nThe students nodded, emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards\\nof sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept, not merely\\nas true, but as axiomatic, self-evident, utterly indisputable.\\n\\n\\n\"But after all,\" Lenina was protesting, \"it\\'s only about four months now\\nsince I\\'ve been having Henry.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Only four months! I like that. And what\\'s more,\" Fanny went on, pointing\\nan accusing finger, \"there\\'s been nobody else except Henry all that time. Has\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\\nLenina blushed scarlet; but her eyes, the tone of her voice remained\\ndefiant. \"No, there hasn\\'t been any one else,\" she answered almost truculently.\\n\"And I jolly well don\\'t see why there should have been.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, she jolly well doesn\\'t see why there should have been,\" Fanny\\nrepeated, as though to an invisible listener behind Lenina\\'s left shoulder.\\nThen, with a sudden change of tone, \"But seriously,\" she said, \"I really do\\nthink you ought to be careful. It\\'s such horribly bad form to go on and on\\nlike this with one man. At forty, or thirty-five, it wouldn\\'t be so bad. But\\nat your age, Lenina! No, it really won\\'t do. And you know how strongly\\nthe D.H.C. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. Four months of Henry\\nFoster, without having another man–why, he\\'d be furious if he knew …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Think of water under pressure in a pipe.\" They thought of it. \"I pierce\\nit once,\" said the Controller. \"What a jet!\"\\n\\n\\nHe pierced it twenty times. There were twenty piddling little fountains.\\n\\n\\n\"My baby. My baby …!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Mother!\" The madness is infectious.\\n\\n\\n\"My love, my one and only, precious, precious …\"\\n\\n\\nMother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the\\nwild jet. The urge has but a single outlet. My love, my baby. No wonder these\\npoor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn\\'t allow\\nthem to take things easily, didn\\'t allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy.\\nWhat with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not\\nconditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what\\nwith all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the\\nuncertainties and the poverty–they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling\\nstrongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual\\nisolation), how could they be stable?\\n\\n\\n\"Of course there\\'s no need to give him up. Have somebody else from time to\\ntime, that\\'s all. He has other girls, doesn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\\nLenina admitted it.\\n\\n\\n\"Of course he does. Trust Henry Foster to be the perfect gentleman–always\\ncorrect. And then there\\'s the Director to think of. You know what a stickler\\n…\"\\n\\n\\nNodding, \"He patted me on the behind this afternoon,\" said Lenina.\\n\\n\\n\"There, you see!\" Fanny was triumphant. \"That shows what he stands\\nfor. The strictest conventionality.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Stability,\" said the Controller, \"stability. No civilization without\\nsocial stability. No social stability without individual stability.\" His voice\\nwas a trumpet. Listening they felt larger, warmer.\\n\\n\\nThe machine turns, turns and must keep on turning–for ever. It is death if\\nit stands still. A thousand millions scrabbled the crust of the earth. The\\nwheels began to turn. In a hundred and fifty years there were two thousand\\nmillions. Stop all the wheels. In a hundred and fifty weeks there are once\\nmore only a thousand millions; a thousand thousand thousand men and women have\\nstarved to death.\\n\\n\\nWheels must turn steadily, but cannot turn untended. There must be men to\\ntend them, men as steady as the wheels upon their axles, sane men, obedient\\nmen, stable in contentment.\\n\\n\\nCrying: My baby, my mother, my only, only love groaning: My sin, my\\nterrible God; screaming with pain, muttering with fever, bemoaning old age and\\npoverty–how can they tend the wheels? And if they cannot tend the wheels … The\\ncorpses of a thousand thousand thousand men and women would be hard to bury or\\nburn.\\n\\n\\n\"And after all,\" Fanny\\'s tone was coaxing, \"it\\'s not as though there were\\nanything painful or disagreeable about having one or two men besides Henry.\\nAnd seeing that you ought to be a little more promiscuous …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Stability,\" insisted the Controller, \"stability. The primal and the\\nultimate need. Stability. Hence all this.\"\\n\\n\\nWith a wave of his hand he indicated the gardens, the huge building of the\\nConditioning Centre, the naked children furtive in the undergrowth or running\\nacross the lawns.\\n\\n\\nLenina shook her head. \"Somehow,\" she mused, \"I hadn\\'t been feeling very\\nkeen on promiscuity lately. There are times when one doesn\\'t. Haven\\'t you\\nfound that too, Fanny?\"\\n\\n\\nFanny nodded her sympathy and understanding. \"But one\\'s got to make the\\neffort,\" she said, sententiously, \"one\\'s got to play the game. After all,\\nevery one belongs to every one else.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, every one belongs to every one else,\" Lenina repeated slowly and,\\nsighing, was silent for a moment; then, taking Fanny\\'s hand, gave it a little\\nsqueeze. \"You\\'re quite right, Fanny. As usual. I\\'ll make the effort.\"\\n\\n\\nImpulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is\\npassion, the flood is even madness: it depends on the force of the current,\\nthe height and strength of the barrier. The unchecked stream flows smoothly\\ndown its appointed channels into a calm well-being. (The embryo is hungry; day\\nin, day out, the blood-surrogate pump unceasingly turns its eight hundred\\nrevolutions a minute. The decanted infant howls; at once a nurse appears with\\na bottle of external secretion. Feeling lurks in that interval of time between\\ndesire and its consummation. Shorten that interval, break down all those old\\nunnecessary barriers.\\n\\n\\n\"Fortunate boys!\" said the Controller. \"No pains have been spared to make\\nyour lives emotionally easy–to preserve you, so far as that is possible, from\\nhaving emotions at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ford\\'s in his flivver,\" murmured the D.H.C. \"All\\'s well with the world.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Lenina Crowne?\" said Henry Foster, echoing the Assistant Predestinator\\'s\\nquestion as he zipped up his trousers. \"Oh, she\\'s a splendid girl. Wonderfully\\npneumatic. I\\'m surprised you haven\\'t had her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t think how it is I haven\\'t,\" said the Assistant Predestinator. \"I\\ncertainly will. At the first opportunity.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle, Bernard\\nMarx overheard what they were saying and turned pale.\\n\\n\\n\"And to tell the truth,\" said Lenina, \"I\\'m beginning to get just a tiny\\nbit bored with nothing but Henry every day.\" She pulled on her left stocking.\\n\"Do you know Bernard Marx?\" she asked in a tone whose excessive casualness was\\nevidently forced.\\n\\n\\nFanny looked startled. \"You don\\'t mean to say …?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why not? Bernard\\'s an Alpha Plus. Besides, he asked me to go to one of\\nthe Savage Reservations with him. I\\'ve always wanted to see a Savage\\nReservation.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But his reputation?\"\\n\\n\\n\"What do I care about his reputation?\"\\n\\n\\n\"They say he doesn\\'t like Obstacle Golf.\"\\n\\n\\n\"They say, they say,\" mocked Lenina.\\n\\n\\n\"And then he spends most of his time by himself–alone.\" There was horror\\nin Fanny\\'s voice.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, he won\\'t be alone when he\\'s with me. And anyhow, why are people so\\nbeastly to him? I think he\\'s rather sweet.\" She smiled to herself; how\\nabsurdly shy he had been! Frightened almost–as though she were a World\\nController and he a Gamma-Minus machine minder.\\n\\n\\n\"Consider your own lives,\" said Mustapha Mond. \"Has any of you ever\\nencountered an insurmountable obstacle?\"\\n\\n\\nThe question was answered by a negative silence.\\n\\n\\n\"Has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval\\nbetween the consciousness of a desire and its fufilment?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" began one of the boys, and hesitated.\\n\\n\\n\"Speak up,\" said the D.H.C. \"Don\\'t keep his fordship waiting.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I once had to wait nearly four weeks before a girl I wanted would let me\\nhave her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And you felt a strong emotion in consequence?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Horrible!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Horrible; precisely,\" said the Controller. \"Our ancestors were so stupid\\nand short-sighted that when the first reformers came along and offered to\\ndeliver them from those horrible emotions, they wouldn\\'t have anything to do\\nwith them.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Talking about her as though she were a bit of meat.\" Bernard ground his\\nteeth. \"Have her here, have her there.\" Like mutton. Degrading her to so much\\nmutton. She said she\\'d think it over, she said she\\'d give me an answer this\\nweek. Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford.\" He would have liked to go up to them and hit them\\nin the face–hard, again and again.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I really do advise you to try her,\" Henry Foster was saying.\\n\\n\\n\"Take Ectogenesis. Pfitzner and Kawaguchi had got the whole technique\\nworked out. But would the Governments look at it? No. There was something\\ncalled Christianity. Women were forced to go on being viviparous.\"\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s so ugly!\" said Fanny.\\n\\n\\n\"But I rather like his looks.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And then so small.\" Fanny made a grimace; smallness was so\\nhorribly and typically low-caste.\\n\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s rather sweet,\" said Lenina. \"One feels one would like to\\npet him. You know. Like a cat.\"\\n\\n\\nFanny was shocked. \"They say somebody made a mistake when he was still in\\nthe bottle–thought he was a Gamma and put alcohol into his blood-surrogate.\\nThat\\'s why he\\'s so stunted.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What nonsense!\" Lenina was indignant.\\n\\n\\n\"Sleep teaching was actually prohibited in England. There was something\\ncalled liberalism. Parliament, if you know what that was, passed a law against\\nit. The records survive. Speeches about liberty of the subject. Liberty to be\\ninefficient and miserable. Freedom to be a round peg in a square hole.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, my dear chap, you\\'re welcome, I assure you. You\\'re welcome.\" Henry\\nFoster patted the Assistant Predestinator on the shoulder. \"Every one belongs\\nto every one else, after all.\"\\n\\n\\nOne hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years, thought\\nBernard Marx, who was a specialist on hypnopædia. Sixty-two thousand four\\nhundred repetitions make one truth. Idiots!\\n\\n\\n\"Or the Caste System. Constantly proposed, constantly rejected. There was\\nsomething called democracy. As though men were more than physico-chemically\\nequal.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, all I can say is that I\\'m going to accept his invitation.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard hated them, hated them. But they were two, they were large, they\\nwere strong.\\n\\n\\n\"The Nine Years\\' War began in A.F. 141.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not even if it were true about the alcohol in his\\nblood-surrogate.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Phosgene, chloropicrin, ethyl iodoacetate, diphenylcyanarsine,\\ntrichlormethyl, chloroformate, dichlorethyl sulphide. Not to mention\\nhydrocyanic acid.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Which I simply don\\'t believe,\" Lenina concluded.\\n\\n\\n\"The noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. But in\\nthe Kurfurstendamm and the Eighth Arrondissement, the explosion of the anthrax\\nbombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because I do want to see a Savage Reservation.\"\\n\\n\\nCh3C6H2(NO2)3+Hg(CNO)2=well,\\nwhat? An enormous hole in the ground, a pile of masonry, some bits of flesh\\nand mucus, a foot, with the boot still on it, flying through the air and\\nlanding, flop, in the middle of the geraniums–the scarlet ones; such a\\nsplendid show that summer!\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re hopeless, Lenina, I give you up.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The Russian technique for infecting water supplies was particularly\\ningenious.\"\\n\\n\\nBack turned to back, Fanny and Lenina continued their changing in silence.\\n\\n\\n\"The Nine Years\\' War, the great Economic Collapse. There was a choice\\nbetween World Control and destruction. Between stability and …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Fanny Crowne\\'s a nice girl too,\" said the Assistant Predestinator.\\n\\n\\nIn the nurseries, the Elementary Class Consciousness lesson was over, the\\nvoices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. \"I do love\\nflying,\" they whispered, \"I do love flying, I do love having new clothes, I do\\nlove …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Liberalism, of course, was dead of anthrax, but all the same you couldn\\'t\\ndo things by force.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not nearly so pneumatic as Lenina. Oh, not nearly.\"\\n\"But old clothes are beastly,\" continued the untiring whisper. \"We\\nalways throw away old clothes. Ending is better than mending, ending is better\\nthan mending, ending is better …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Government\\'s an affair of sitting, not hitting. You rule with the brains\\nand the buttocks, never with the fists. For example, there was the\\nconscription of consumption.\"\\n\\n\\n\"There, I\\'m ready,\" said Lenina, but Fanny remained speechless and\\naverted. \"Let\\'s make peace, Fanny darling.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Every man, woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. In the\\ninterests of industry. The sole result …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches; the\\nmore stitches …\"\\n\\n\\n\"One of these days,\" said Fanny, with dismal emphasis, \"you\\'ll get into\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Conscientious objection on an enormous scale. Anything not to consume.\\nBack to nature.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I do love flying. I do love flying.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can\\'t consume much if you\\nsit still and read books.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Do I look all right?\" Lenina asked. Her jacket was made of bottle green\\nacetate cloth with green viscose fur; at the cuffs and collar.\\n\\n\\n\"Eight hundred Simple Lifers were mowed down by machine guns at Golders\\nGreen.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending.\"\\n\\n\\nGreen corduroy shorts and white viscose-woollen stockings turned down\\nbelow the knee.\\n\\n\\n\"Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans\\ngassed with dichlorethyl sulphide.\"\\n\\n\\nA green-and-white jockey cap shaded Lenina\\'s eyes; her shoes were bright\\ngreen and highly polished.\\n\\n\\n\"In the end,\" said Mustapha Mond, \"the Controllers realized that force was\\nno good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian\\nconditioning and hypnopædia …\"\\n\\n\\nAnd round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate\\ncartridge belt, bulging (for Lenina was not a freemartin) with the regulation\\nsupply of contraceptives.\\n\\n\\n\"The discoveries of Pfitzner and Kawaguchi were at last made use of. An\\nintensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Perfect!\" cried Fanny enthusiastically. She could never resist Lenina\\'s\\ncharm for long. \"And what a perfectly sweet Malthusian belt!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Accompanied by a campaign against the Past; by the closing of museums,\\nthe blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been\\ndestroyed during the Nine Years\\' War); by the suppression of all books\\npublished before A.F. 15O.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\"I simply must get one like it,\" said Fanny.\\n\\n\\n\"There were some things called the pyramids, for example.\\n\\n\\n\"My old black-patent bandolier …\"\\n\\n\\n\"And a man called Shakespeare. You\\'ve never heard of them of course.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s an absolute disgrace–that bandolier of mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Such are the advantages of a really scientific education.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The more stitches the less riches; the more stitches the less …\"\\n\\n\\n\"The introduction of Our Ford\\'s first T-Model …\"\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had it nearly three months.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Chosen as the opening date of the new era.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ending is better than mending; ending is better …\"\\n\\n\\n\"There was a thing, as I\\'ve said before, called Christianity.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ending is better than mending.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The ethics and philosophy of under-consumption …\"\\n\\n\\n\"I love new clothes, I love new clothes, I love …\"\\n\\n\\n\"So essential when there was under-production; but in an age of machines\\nand the fixation of nitrogen–positively a crime against society.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Henry Foster gave it me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"All crosses had their tops cut and became T\\'s. There was also a thing\\ncalled God.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s real morocco-surrogate.\"\\n\\n\\n\"We have the World State now.

She\\nwas a popular girl and, at one time or another, had spent a night with almost\\nall of them.\\n\\nThey were dear boys, she thought, as she returned their salutations.\\nCharming boys! Still, she did wish that George Edzel\\'s ears weren\\'t quite so\\nbig (perhaps he\\'d been given just a spot too much parathyroid at Metre 328?).\\nAnd looking at Benito Hoover, she couldn\\'t help remembering that he was really\\ntoo hairy when he took his clothes off.\\n\\n\\nTurning, with eyes a little saddened by the recollection, of Benito\\'s\\ncurly blackness, she saw in a corner the small thin body, the melancholy face\\nof Bernard Marx.\\n\\n\\n\"Bernard!\" she stepped up to him. \"I was looking for you.\" Her voice rang\\nclear above the hum of the mounting lift. The others looked round curiously.\\n\"I wanted to talk to you about our New Mexico plan.\" Out of the tail of her\\neye she could see Benito Hoover gaping with astonishment. The gape annoyed\\nher. \"Surprised I shouldn\\'t be begging to go with him again!\" she said\\nto herself. Then aloud, and more warmly than ever, \"I\\'d simply love to\\ncome with you for a week in July,\" she went on. (Anyhow, she was publicly\\nproving her unfaithfulness to Henry. Fanny ought to be pleased, even though it\\nwas Bernard.) \"That is,\" Lenina gave him her most deliciously significant\\nsmile, \"if you still want to have me.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard\\'s pale face flushed. \"What on earth for?\" she wondered,\\nastonished, but at the same time touched by this strange tribute to her power.\\n\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t we better talk about it somewhere else?\" he stammered, looking\\nhorribly uncomfortable.\\n\\n\\n\"As though I\\'d been saying something shocking,\" thought Lenina. \"He\\ncouldn\\'t look more upset if I\\'d made a dirty joke–asked him who his mother\\nwas, or something like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I mean, with all these people about …\" He was choked with confusion.\\n\\n\\nLenina\\'s laugh was frank and wholly unmalicious. \"How funny you are!\" she\\nsaid; and she quite genuinely did think him funny. \"You\\'ll give me at least a\\nweek\\'s warning, won\\'t you,\" she went on in another tone. \"I suppose we take\\nthe Blue Pacific Rocket? Does it start from the Charing-T Tower? Or is it from\\nHampstead?\"\\n\\n\\nBefore Bernard could answer, the lift came to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\"Roof!\" called a creaking voice.\\n\\n\\nThe liftman was a small simian creature, dressed in the black tunic of an\\nEpsilon-Minus Semi-Moron.\\n\\n\\n\"Roof!\"\\n\\n\\nHe flung open the gates. The warm glory of afternoon sunlight made him\\nstart and blink his eyes. \"Oh, roof!\" he repeated in a voice of rapture. He\\nwas as though suddenly and joyfully awakened from a dark annihilating stupor.\\n\"Roof!\"\\n\\n\\nHe smiled up with a kind of doggily expectant adoration into the faces of\\nhis passengers. Talking and laughing together, they stepped out into the\\nlight. The liftman looked after them.\\n\\n\\n\"Roof?\" he said once more, questioningly.\\n\\n\\nThen a bell rang, and from the ceiling of the lift a loud speaker began,\\nvery softly and yet very imperiously, to issue its commands.\\n\\n\\n\"Go down,\" it said, \"go down. Floor Eighteen. Go down, go down. Floor\\nEighteen. Go down, go …\"\\n\\n\\nThe liftman slammed the gates, touched a button and instantly dropped back\\ninto the droning twilight of the well, the twilight of his own habitual\\nstupor.\\n\\n\\nIt was warm and bright on the roof. The summer afternoon was drowsy with\\nthe hum of passing helicopters; and the deeper drone of the rocket-planes\\nhastening, invisible, through the bright sky five or six miles overhead was\\nlike a caress on the soft air. Bernard Marx drew a deep breath. He looked up\\ninto the sky and round the blue horizon and finally down into Lenina\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it beautiful!\" His voice trembled a little.\\n\\n\\nShe smiled at him with an expression of the most sympathetic\\nunderstanding. \"Simply perfect for Obstacle Golf,\" she answered rapturously.\\n\"And now I must fly, Bernard. Henry gets cross if I keep him waiting. Let me\\nknow in good time about the date.\" And waving her hand she ran away across the\\nwide flat roof towards the hangars. Bernard stood watching the retreating\\ntwinkle of the white stockings, the sunburnt knees vivaciously bending and\\nunbending again, again, and the softer rolling of those well-fitted corduroy\\nshorts beneath the bottle green jacket. His face wore an expression of pain.\\n\\n\\n\"I should say she was pretty,\" said a loud and cheery voice just behind\\nhim.\\n\\n\\nBernard started and looked around. The chubby red face of Benito Hoover\\nwas beaming down at him–beaming with manifest cordiality. Benito was\\nnotoriously good-natured. People said of him that he could have got through\\nlife without ever touching soma. The malice and bad tempers from which\\nother people had to take holidays never afflicted him. Reality for Benito was\\nalways sunny.\\n\\n\\n\"Pneumatic too. And how!\" Then, in another tone: \"But, I say,\" he went on,\\n\"you do look glum! What you need is a gramme of soma.\" Diving into his\\nright-hand trouser-pocket, Benito produced a phial. \"One cubic centimetre\\ncures ten gloomy … But, I say!\"\\n\\n\\nBernard had suddenly turned and rushed away.\\n\\n\\nBenito stared after him. \"What can be the matter with the fellow?\" he\\nwondered, and, shaking his head, decided that the story about the alcohol\\nhaving been put into the poor chap\\'s blood-surrogate must be true. \"Touched\\nhis brain, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\nHe put away the soma bottle, and taking out a packet of sex-hormone\\nchewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away towards the\\nhangars, ruminating.\\n\\n\\nHenry Foster had had his machine wheeled out of its lock-up and, when\\nLenina arrived, was already seated in the cockpit, waiting.\\n\\n\\n\"Four minutes late,\" was all his comment, as she climbed in beside him. He\\nstarted the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. The machine\\nshot vertically into the air. Henry accelerated; the humming of the propeller\\nshrilled from hornet to wasp, from wasp to mosquito; the speedometer showed\\nthat they were rising at the best part of two kilometres a minute. London\\ndiminished beneath them. The huge table-topped buildings were no more, in a\\nfew seconds, than a bed of geometrical mushrooms sprouting from the green of\\npark and garden. In the midst of them, thin-stalked, a taller, slenderer\\nfungus, the Charing-T Tower lifted towards the sky a disk of shining concrete.\\n\\n\\nLike the vague torsos of fabulous athletes, huge fleshy clouds lolled on\\nthe blue air above their heads. Out of one of them suddenly dropped a small\\nscarlet insect, buzzing as it fell.\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s the Red Rocket,\" said Henry, \"just come in from New York.\"\\nLooking at his watch. \"Seven minutes behind time,\" he added, and shook his\\nhead. \"These Atlantic services–they\\'re really scandalously unpunctual.\"\\n\\n\\nHe took his foot off the accelerator. The humming of the screws overhead\\ndropped an octave and a half, back through wasp and hornet to bumble bee, to\\ncockchafer, to stag-beetle. The upward rush of the machine slackened off; a\\nmoment later they were hanging motionless in the air. Henry pushed at a lever;\\nthere was a click. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, till it was a\\ncircular mist before their eyes, the propeller in front of them began to\\nrevolve. The wind of a horizontal speed whistled ever more shrilly in the\\nstays. Henry kept his eye on the revolution-counter; when the needle touched\\nthe twelve hundred mark, he threw the helicopter screws out of gear. The\\nmachine had enough forward momentum to be able to fly on its planes.\\n\\n\\nLenina looked down through the window in the floor between her feet. They\\nwere flying over the six kilometre zone of park-land that separated Central\\nLondon from its first ring of satellite suburbs. The green was maggoty with\\nfore-shortened life. Forests of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy towers gleamed\\nbetween the trees. Near Shepherd\\'s Bush two thousand Beta-Minus mixed doubles\\nwere playing Riemann-surface tennis. A double row of Escalator Fives Courts\\nlined the main road from Notting Hill to Willesden. In the Ealing stadium a\\nDelta gymnastic display and community sing was in progress.\\n\\n\\n\"What a hideous colour khaki is,\" remarked Lenina, voicing the hypnopædic\\nprejudices of her caste.\\n\\n\\nThe buildings of the Hounslow Feely Studio covered seven and a half\\nhectares. Near them a black and khaki army of labourers was busy revitrifying\\nthe surface of the Great West Road. One of the huge travelling crucibles was\\nbeing tapped as they flew over. The molten stone poured out in a stream of\\ndazzling incandescence across the road, the asbestos rollers came and went; at\\nthe tail of an insulated watering cart the steam rose in white clouds.\\n\\n\\nAt Brentford the Television Corporation\\'s factory was like a small town.\\n\\n\\n\"They must be changing the shift,\" said Lenina.\\n\\n\\nLike aphides and ants, the leaf-green Gamma girls, the black Semi-Morons\\nswarmed round the entrances, or stood in queues to take their places in the\\nmonorail tram-cars. Mulberry-coloured Beta-Minuses came and went among the\\ncrowd. The roof of the main building was alive with the alighting and\\ndeparture of helicopters.\\n\\n\\n\"My word,\" said Lenina, \"I\\'m glad I\\'m not a Gamma.\"\\n\\n\\nTen minutes later they were at Stoke Poges and had started their first\\nround of Obstacle Golf.\\n\\n§ 2\\nWITH eyes for the most part downcast and, if ever they\\nlighted on a fellow creature, at once and furtively averted, Bernard hastened\\nacross the roof. He was like a man pursued, but pursued by enemies he does not\\nwish to see, lest they should seem more hostile even than he had supposed, and\\nhe himself be made to feel guiltier and even more helplessly alone.\\n\\n\"That horrible Benito Hoover!\" And yet the man had meant well enough.\\nWhich only made it, in a way, much worse. Those who meant well behaved in the\\nsame way as those who meant badly. Even Lenina was making him suffer. He\\nremembered those weeks of timid indecision, during which he had looked and\\nlonged and despaired of ever having the courage to ask her. Dared he face the\\nrisk of being humiliated by a contemptuous refusal? But if she were to say\\nyes, what rapture! Well, now she had said it and he was still\\nwretched–wretched that she should have thought it such a perfect afternoon for\\nObstacle Golf, that she should have trotted away to join Henry Foster, that\\nshe should have found him funny for not wanting to talk of their most private\\naffairs in public. Wretched, in a word, because she had behaved as any healthy\\nand virtuous English girl ought to behave and not in some other, abnormal,\\nextraordinary way.\\n\\n\\nHe opened the door of his lock-up and called to a lounging couple of\\nDelta-Minus attendants to come and push his machine out on to the roof. The\\nhangars were staffed by a single Bokanovsky Group, and the men were twins,\\nidentically small, black and hideous. Bernard gave his orders in the sharp,\\nrather arrogant and even offensive tone of one who does not feel himself too\\nsecure in his superiority. To have dealings with members of the lower castes\\nwas always, for Bernard, a most distressing experience. For whatever the cause\\n(and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very\\nlikely–for accidents will happen–have been true) Bernard\\'s physique was hardly\\nbetter than that of the average Gamma. He stood eight centimetres short of the\\nstandard Alpha height and was slender in proportion. Contact with members of\\nthe lower castes always reminded him painfully of this physical inadequacy. \"I\\nam I, and wish I wasn\\'t\"; his self-consciousness was acute and stressing. Each\\ntime he found himself looking on the level, instead of downward, into a\\nDelta\\'s face, he felt humiliated. Would the creature treat him with the\\nrespect due to his caste? The question haunted him. Not without reason. For\\nGammas, Deltas and Epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate\\ncorporeal mass with social superiority. Indeed, a faint hypnopædic prejudice\\nin favour of size was universal. Hence the laughter of the women to whom he\\nmade proposals, the practical joking of his equals among the men. The mockery\\nmade him feel an outsider; and feeling an outsider he behaved like one, which\\nincreased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility\\naroused by his physical defects. Which in turn increased his sense of being\\nalien and alone. A chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals,\\nmade him stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his\\ndignity. How bitterly he envied men like Henry Foster and Benito Hoover! Men\\nwho never had to shout at an Epsilon to get an order obeyed; men who took\\ntheir position for granted; men who moved through the caste system as a fish\\nthrough water–so utterly at home as to be unaware either of themselves or of\\nthe beneficent and comfortable element in which they had their being.\\n\\n\\nSlackly, it seemed to him, and with reluctance, the twin attendants\\nwheeled his plane out on the roof.\\n\\n\\n\"Hurry up!\" said Bernard irritably. One of them glanced at him. Was that a\\nkind of bestial derision that he detected in those blank grey eyes? \"Hurry\\nup!\" he shouted more loudly, and there was an ugly rasp in his voice.\\n\\n\\nHe climbed into the plane and, a minute later, was flying southwards,\\ntowards the river.\\n\\n\\nThe various Bureaux of Propaganda and the College of Emotional Engineering\\nwere housed in a single sixty-story building in Fleet Street. In the basement\\nand on the low floors were the presses and offices of the three great London\\nnewspapers–The Hourly Radio, an upper-caste sheet, the pale green\\nGamma Gazette, and, on khaki paper and in words exclusively of one\\nsyllable, The Delta Mirror. Then came the Bureaux of Propaganda by\\nTelevision, by Feeling Picture, and by Synthetic Voice and Music\\nrespectively–twenty-two floors of them. Above were the search laboratories and\\nthe padded rooms in which Sound-Track Writers and Synthetic Composers did the\\ndelicate work. The top eighteen floors were occupied the College of Emotional\\nEngineering.\\n\\n\\nBernard landed on the roof of Propaganda House and stepped out.\\n\\n\\n\"Ring down to Mr. Helmholtz Watson,\" he ordered the Gamma-Plus porter,\\n\"and tell him that Mr. Bernard Marx is waiting for him on the roof.\"\\n\\n\\nHe sat down and lit a cigarette.\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz Watson was writing when the message came down.\\n\\n\\n\"Tell him I\\'m coming at once,\" he said and hung up the receiver. Then,\\nturning to his secretary, \"I\\'ll leave you to put my things away,\" he went on\\nin the same official and impersonal tone; and, ignoring her lustrous smile,\\ngot up and walked briskly to the door.\\n\\n\\nHe was a powerfully built man, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, massive,\\nand yet quick in his movements, springy and agile. The round strong pillar of\\nhis neck supported a beautifully shaped head. His hair was dark and curly, his\\nfeatures strongly marked. In a forcible emphatic way, he was handsome and\\nlooked, as his secretary was never tired of repeating, every centimetre an\\nAlpha Plus. By profession he was a lecturer at the College of Emotional\\nEngineering (Department of Writing) and the intervals of his educational\\nactivities, a working Emotional Engineer. He wrote regularly for The Hourly\\nRadio, composed feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans\\nand hypnopædic rhymes.\\n\\n\\n\"Able,\" was the verdict of his superiors. \"Perhaps, (and they would shake\\ntheir heads, would significantly lower their voices) \"a little too\\nable.\"\\n\\n\\nYes, a little too able; they were right. A mental excess had produced in\\nHelmholtz Watson effects very similar to those which, in Bernard Marx, were\\nthe result of a physical defect. Too little bone and brawn had isolated\\nBernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, being, by all\\nthe current standards, a mental excess, became in its turn a cause of wider\\nseparation. That which had made Helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being\\nhimself and all alone was too much ability. What the two men shared was\\nthe knowledge that they were individuals. But whereas the physically defective\\nBernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate, it\\nwas only quite recently that, grown aware of his mental excess, Helmholtz\\nWatson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded\\nhim. This Escalator-Squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was said\\nthat he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years),\\nthis admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that\\nsport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned,\\nsecond bests. Really, and at the bottom, he was interested in something else.\\nBut in what? In what? That was the problem which Bernard had come to discuss\\nwith him–or rather, since it was always Helmholtz who did all the talking, to\\nlisten to his friend discussing, yet once more.\\n\\n\\nThree charming girls from the Bureau of Propaganda by Synthetic Voice\\nwaylaid him as he stepped out of the lift.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Helmholtz, darling, do come and have a picnic supper with us\\non Exmoor.\" They clung round him imploringly.\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head, he pushed his way through them. \"No, no.\"\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re not inviting any other man.\"\\n\\n\\nBut Helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. \"No,\" he\\nrepeated, \"I\\'m busy.\" And he held resolutely on his course. The girls trailed\\nafter him. It was not till he had actually climbed into Bernard\\'s plane and\\nslammed the door that they gave up pursuit. Not without reproaches.\\n\\n\\n\"These women!\" he said, as the machine rose into the air. \"These women!\"\\nAnd he shook his head, he frowned. \"Too awful,\" Bernard hypocritically agreed,\\nwishing, as he spoke the words, that he could have as many girls as Helmholtz\\ndid, and with as little trouble. He was seized with a sudden urgent need to\\nboast. \"I\\'m taking Lenina Crowne to New Mexico with me,\" he said in a tone as\\ncasual as he could make it.\\n\\n\\n\"Are you?\" said Helmholtz, with a total absence of interest. Then after a\\nlittle pause, \"This last week or two,\" he went on, \"I\\'ve been cutting all my\\ncommittees and all my girls. You can\\'t imagine what a hullabaloo they\\'ve been\\nmaking about it at the College. Still, it\\'s been worth it, I think. The\\neffects …\" He hesitated. \"Well, they\\'re odd, they\\'re very odd.\"\\n\\n\\nA physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process,\\nit seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes,\\nthe voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial\\nimpotence of asceticism.\\n\\n\\nThe rest of the short flight was accomplished in silence. When they had\\narrived and were comfortably stretched out on the pneumatic sofas in Bernard\\'s\\nroom, Helmholtz began again.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking very slowly, \"Did you ever feel,\" he asked, \"as though you had\\nsomething inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come\\nout? Some sort of extra power that you aren\\'t using–you know, like all the\\nwater that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?\" He looked at\\nBernard questioningly.\\n\\n\\n\"You mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different?\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz shook his head. \"Not quite. I\\'m thinking of a queer feeling I\\nsometimes get, a feeling that I\\'ve got something important to say and the\\npower to say it–only I don\\'t know what it is, and I can\\'t make any use of the\\npower. If there was some different way of writing … Or else something else to\\nwrite about …\" He was silent; then, \"You see,\" he went on at last, \"I\\'m pretty\\ngood at inventing phrases–you know, the sort of words that suddenly make you\\njump, almost as though you\\'d sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even\\nthough they\\'re about something hypnopædically obvious. But that doesn\\'t seem\\nenough. It\\'s not enough for the phrases to be good; what you make with them\\nought to be good too.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But your things are good, Helmholtz.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, as far as they go.\" Helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. \"But they go\\nsuch a little way. They aren\\'t important enough, somehow. I feel I could do\\nsomething much more important. Yes, and more intense, more violent. But what?\\nWhat is there more important to say? And how can one be violent about the sort\\nof things one\\'s expected to write about? Words can be like X-rays, if you use\\nthem properly–they\\'ll go through anything. You read and you\\'re pierced. That\\'s\\none of the things I try to teach my students–how to write piercingly. But what\\non earth\\'s the good of being pierced by an article about a Community Sing, or\\nthe latest improvement in scent organs? Besides, can you make words really\\npiercing–you know, like the very hardest X-rays–when you\\'re writing about that\\nsort of thing? Can you say something about nothing? That\\'s what it finally\\nboils down to. I try and I try …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Bernard suddenly, and lifted a warning finger; they listened.\\n\"I believe there\\'s somebody at the door,\" he whispered.\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz got up, tiptoed across the room, and with a sharp quick movement\\nflung the door wide open. There was, of course, nobody there.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" said Bernard, feeling and looking uncomfortably foolish. \"I\\nsuppose I\\'ve got things on my nerves a bit. When people are suspicious with\\nyou, you start being suspicious with them.\"\\n\\n\\nHe passed his hand across his eyes, he sighed, his voice became plaintive.\\nHe was justifying himself. \"If you knew what I\\'d had to put up with recently,\"\\nhe said almost tearfully–and the uprush of his self-pity was like a fountain\\nsuddenly released. \"If you only knew!\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz Watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. \"Poor little\\nBernard!\" he said to himself.

The loud\\nspeaker in the tower of the Stoke Poges Club House began, in a more than human\\ntenor, to announce the closing of the courses. Lenina and Henry abandoned\\ntheir game and walked back towards the Club. From the grounds of the Internal\\nand External Secretion Trust came the lowing of those thousands of cattle\\nwhich provided, with their hormones and their milk, the raw materials for the\\ngreat factory at Farnham Royal.\\n\\nAn incessant buzzing of helicopters filled the twilight. Every two and a\\nhalf minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced the departure of one\\nof the light monorail trains which carried the lower caste golfers back from\\ntheir separate course to the metropolis.\\n\\n\\nLenina and Henry climbed into their machine and started off. At eight\\nhundred feet Henry slowed down the helicopter screws, and they hung for a\\nminute or two poised above the fading landscape. The forest of Burnham Beeches\\nstretched like a great pool of darkness towards the bright shore of the\\nwestern sky. Crimson at the horizon, the last of the sunset faded, through\\norange, upwards into yellow and a pale watery green. Northwards, beyond and\\nabove the trees, the Internal and External Secretions factory glared with a\\nfierce electric brilliance from every window of its twenty stories. Beneath\\nthem lay the buildings of the Golf Club–the huge Lower Caste barracks and, on\\nthe other side of a dividing wall, the smaller houses reserved for Alpha and\\nBeta members. The approaches to the monorail station were black with the\\nant-like pullulation of lower-caste activity. From under the glass vault a\\nlighted train shot out into the open. Following its southeasterly course\\nacross the dark plain their eyes were drawn to the majestic buildings of the\\nSlough Crematorium. For the safety of night-flying planes, its four tall\\nchimneys were flood-lighted and tipped with crimson danger signals. It was a\\nlandmark.\\n\\n\\n\"Why do the smoke-stacks have those things like balconies around them?\"\\nenquired Lenina.\\n\\n\\n\"Phosphorus recovery,\" explained Henry telegraphically. \"On their way up\\nthe chimney the gases go through four separate treatments.\\nP2O5 used to go right out of circulation every time they\\ncremated some one. Now they recover over ninety-eight per cent of it. More\\nthan a kilo and a half per adult corpse. Which makes the best part of four\\nhundred tons of phosphorus every year from England alone.\" Henry spoke with a\\nhappy pride, rejoicing whole-heartedly in the achievement, as though it had\\nbeen his own. \"Fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after\\nwe\\'re dead. Making plants grow.\"\\n\\n\\nLenina, meanwhile, had turned her eyes away and was looking\\nperpendicularly downwards at the monorail station. \"Fine,\" she agreed. \"But\\nqueer that Alphas and Betas won\\'t make any more plants grow than those nasty\\nlittle Gammas and Deltas and Epsilons down there.\"\\n\\n\\n\"All men are physico-chemically equal,\" said Henry sententiously.\\n\"Besides, even Epsilons perform indispensable services.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Even an Epsilon …\" Lenina suddenly remembered an occasion when, as a\\nlittle girl at school, she had woken up in the middle of the night and become\\naware, for the first time, of the whispering that had haunted all her sleeps.\\nShe saw again the beam of moonlight, the row of small white beds; heard once\\nmore the soft, soft voice that said (the words were there, unforgotten,\\nunforgettable after so many night-long repetitions): \"Every one works for\\nevery one else. We can\\'t do without any one. Even Epsilons are useful. We\\ncouldn\\'t do without Epsilons. Every one works for every one else. We can\\'t do\\nwithout any one …\" Lenina remembered her first shock of fear and surprise; her\\nspeculations through half a wakeful hour; and then, under the influence of\\nthose endless repetitions, the gradual soothing of her mind, the soothing, the\\nsmoothing, the stealthy creeping of sleep. …\\n\\n\\n\"I suppose Epsilons don\\'t really mind being Epsilons,\" she said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\"Of course they don\\'t. How can they? They don\\'t know what it\\'s like being\\nanything else. We\\'d mind, of course. But then we\\'ve been differently\\nconditioned. Besides, we start with a different heredity.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad I\\'m not an Epsilon,\" said Lenina, with conviction.\\n\\n\\n\"And if you were an Epsilon,\" said Henry, \"your conditioning would have\\nmade you no less thankful that you weren\\'t a Beta or an Alpha.\" He put his\\nforward propeller into gear and headed the machine towards London. Behind\\nthem, in the west, the crimson and orange were almost faded; a dark bank of\\ncloud had crept into the zenith. As they flew over the crematorium, the plane\\nshot upwards on the column of hot air rising from the chimneys, only to fall\\nas suddenly when it passed into the descending chill beyond.\\n\\n\\n\"What a marvellous switchback!\" Lenina laughed delightedly.\\n\\n\\nBut Henry\\'s tone was almost, for a moment, melancholy. \"Do you know what\\nthat switchback was?\" he said. \"It was some human being finally and definitely\\ndisappearing. Going up in a squirt of hot gas. It would be curious to know who\\nit was–a man or a woman, an Alpha or an Epsilon. …\" He sighed. Then, in a\\nresolutely cheerful voice, \"Anyhow,\" he concluded, \"there\\'s one thing we can\\nbe certain of; whoever he may have been, he was happy when he was alive.\\nEverybody\\'s happy now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, everybody\\'s happy now,\" echoed Lenina. They had heard the words\\nrepeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years.\\n\\n\\nLanding on the roof of Henry\\'s forty-story apartment house in Westminster,\\nthey went straight down to the dining-hall. There, in a loud and cheerful\\ncompany, they ate an excellent meal. Soma was served with the coffee.\\nLenina took two half-gramme tablets and Henry three. At twenty past nine they\\nwalked across the street to the newly opened Westminster Abbey Cabaret. It was\\na night almost without clouds, moonless and starry; but of this on the whole\\ndepressing fact Lenina and Henry were fortunately unaware. The electric\\nsky-signs effectively shut off the outer darkness. \"CALVIN STOPES AND HIS\\nSIXTEEN SEXOPHONISTS.\" From the façade of the new Abbey the giant letters\\ninvitingly glared. \"LONDON\\'S FINEST SCENT AND COLOUR ORGAN. ALL THE LATEST\\nSYNTHETIC MUSIC.\"\\n\\n\\nThey entered. The air seemed hot and somehow breathless with the scent of\\nambergris and sandalwood. On the domed ceiling of the hall, the colour organ\\nhad momentarily painted a tropical sunset. The Sixteen Sexophonists were\\nplaying an old favourite: \"There ain\\'t no Bottle in all the world like that\\ndear little Bottle of mine.\" Four hundred couples were five-stepping round the\\npolished floor. Lenina and Henry were soon the four hundred and first. The\\nsaxophones wailed like melodious cats under the moon, moaned in the alto and\\ntenor registers as though the little death were upon them. Rich with a wealth\\nof harmonics, their tremulous chorus mounted towards a climax, louder and ever\\nlouder–until at last, with a wave of his hand, the conductor let loose the\\nfinal shattering note of ether-music and blew the sixteen merely human blowers\\nclean out of existence. Thunder in A flat major. And then, in all but silence,\\nin all but darkness, there followed a gradual deturgescence, a\\ndiminuendo sliding gradually, through quarter tones, down, down to a\\nfaintly whispered dominant chord that lingered on (while the five-four rhythms\\nstill pulsed below) charging the darkened seconds with an intense expectancy.\\nAnd at last expectancy was fulfilled. There was a sudden explosive sunrise,\\nand simultaneously, the Sixteen burst into song:\\n\\n\\n\"Bottle of mine, it\\'s you I\\'ve always wanted!\\nBottle of mine, why was I ever decanted?\\n\\xa0\\xa0Skies are blue inside of you,\\n\\xa0\\xa0The weather\\'s always fine;\\nFor\\nThere ain\\'t no Bottle in all the world\\nLike that dear little Bottle of mine.\"\\n\\n\\nFive-stepping with the other four hundred round and round Westminster\\nAbbey, Lenina and Henry were yet dancing in another world–the warm, the richly\\ncoloured, the infinitely friendly world of soma-holiday. How kind, how\\ngood-looking, how delightfully amusing every one was! \"Bottle of mine, it\\'s\\nyou I\\'ve always wanted …\" But Lenina and Henry had what they wanted … They\\nwere inside, here and now-safely inside with the fine weather, the perennially\\nblue sky. And when, exhausted, the Sixteen had laid by their saxophones and\\nthe Synthetic Music apparatus was producing the very latest in slow Malthusian\\nBlues, they might have been twin embryos gently rocking together on the waves\\nof a bottled ocean of blood-surrogate.\\n\\n\\n\"Good-night, dear friends. Good-night, dear friends.\" The loud speakers\\nveiled their commands in a genial and musical politeness. \"Good-night, dear\\nfriends …\"\\n\\n\\nObediently, with all the others, Lenina and Henry left the building. The\\ndepressing stars had travelled quite some way across the heavens. But though\\nthe separating screen of the sky-signs had now to a great extent dissolved,\\nthe two young people still retained their happy ignorance of the night.\\n\\n\\nSwallowing half an hour before closing time, that second dose of\\nsoma had raised a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe\\nand their minds. Bottled, they crossed the street; bottled, they took the lift\\nup to Henry\\'s room on the twenty-eighth floor. And yet, bottled as she was,\\nand in spite of that second gramme of soma, Lenina did not forget to\\ntake all the contraceptive precautions prescribed by the regulations. Years of\\nintensive hypnopædia and, from twelve to seventeen, Malthusian drill three\\ntimes a week had made the taking of these precautions almost as automatic and\\ninevitable as blinking.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, and that reminds me,\" she said, as she came back from the bathroom,\\n\"Fanny Crowne wants to know where you found that lovely green\\nmorocco-surrogate cartridge belt you gave me.\"\\n\\n§ 2\\nALTERNATE Thursdays were Bernard\\'s Solidarity Service\\ndays. After an early dinner at the Aphroditzeum (to which Helrnholtz had\\nrecently been elected under Rule Two) he took leave of his friend and, hailing\\na taxi on the roof told the man to fly to the Fordson Community Singery. The\\nmachine rose a couple of hundred metres, then headed eastwards, and as it\\nturned, there before Bernard\\'s eyes, gigantically beautiful, was the Singery.\\nFlood-lighted, its three hundred and twenty metres of white Carrara-surrogate\\ngleamed with a snowy incandescence over Ludgate Hill; at each of the four\\ncorners of its helicopter platform an immense T shone crimson against the\\nnight, and from the mouths of twenty-four vast golden trumpets rumbled a\\nsolemn synthetic music.\\n\\n\"Damn, I\\'m late,\" Bernard said to himself as he first caught sight of Big\\nHenry, the Singery clock. And sure enough, as he was paying off his cab, Big\\nHenry sounded the hour. \"Ford,\" sang out an immense bass voice from all the\\ngolden trumpets. \"Ford, Ford, Ford …\" Nine times. Bernard ran for the lift.\\n\\n\\nThe great auditorium for Ford\\'s Day celebrations and other massed\\nCommunity Sings was at the bottom of the building. Above it, a hundred to each\\nfloor, were the seven thousand rooms used by Solidarity Groups for their\\nfortnight services. Bernard dropped down to floor thirty-three, hurried along\\nthe corridor, stood hesitating for a moment outside Room 3210, then, having\\nwound himself up, opened the door and walked in.\\n\\n\\nThank Ford! he was not the last. Three chairs of the twelve arranged round\\nthe circular table were still unoccupied. He slipped into the nearest of them\\nas inconspicuously as he could and prepared to frown at the yet later comers\\nwhenever they should arrive.\\n\\n\\nTurning towards him, \"What were you playing this afternoon?\" the girl on\\nhis left enquired. \"Obstacle, or Electro-magnetic?\"\\n\\n\\nBernard looked at her (Ford! it was Morgana Rothschild) and blushingly had\\nto admit that he had been playing neither. Morgana stared at him with\\nastonishment. There was an awkward silence.\\n\\n\\nThen pointedly she turned away and addressed herself to the more sporting\\nman on her left.\\n\\n\\n\"A good beginning for a Solidarity Service,\" thought Bernard miserably,\\nand foresaw for himself yet another failure to achieve atonement. If only he\\nhad given himself time to look around instead of scuttling for the nearest\\nchair! He could have sat between Fifi Bradlaugh and Joanna Diesel. Instead of\\nwhich he had gone and blindly planted himself next to Morgana. Morgana!\\nFord! Those black eyebrows of hers–that eyebrow, rather–for they met above the\\nnose. Ford! And on his right was Clara Deterding. True, Clara\\'s eyebrows\\ndidn\\'t meet. But she was really too pneumatic. Whereas Fifi and Joanna\\nwere absolutely right. Plump, blonde, not too large … And it was that great\\nlout, Tom Kawaguchi, who now took the seat between them.\\n\\n\\nThe last arrival was Sarojini Engels.\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re late,\" said the President of the Group severely. \"Don\\'t let it\\nhappen again.\"\\n\\n\\nSarojini apologized and slid into her place between Jim Bokanovsky and\\nHerbert Bakunin. The group was now complete, the solidarity circle perfect and\\nwithout flaw. Man, woman, man, in a ring of endless alternation round the\\ntable. Twelve of them ready to be made one, waiting to come together, to be\\nfused, to lose their twelve separate identities in a larger being.\\n\\n\\nThe President stood up, made the sign of the T and, switching on the\\nsynthetic music, let loose the soft indefatigable beating of drums and a choir\\nof instruments–near-wind and super-string–that plangently repeated and\\nrepeated the brief and unescapably haunting melody of the first Solidarity\\nHymn. Again, again–and it was not the ear that heard the pulsing rhythm, it\\nwas the midriff; the wail and clang of those recurring harmonies haunted, not\\nthe mind, but the yearning bowels of compassion.\\n\\n\\nThe President made another sign of the T and sat down. The service had\\nbegun. The dedicated soma tablets were placed in the centre of the\\ntable. The loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma was passed from hand\\nto hand and, with the formula, \"I drink to my annihilation,\" twelve times\\nquaffed. Then to the accompaniment of the synthetic orchestra the First\\nSolidarity Hymn was sung.\\n\\n\\n\"Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one,\\n\\xa0\\xa0Like drops within the Social River,\\nOh, make us now together run\\n\\xa0\\xa0As swiftly as thy shining Flivver.\"\\n\\n\\nTwelve yearning stanzas. And then the loving cup was passed a second time.\\n\"I drink to the Greater Being\" was now the formula. All drank. Tirelessly the\\nmusic played. The drums beat. The crying and clashing of the harmonies were an\\nobsession in the melted bowels. The Second Solidarity Hymn was sung.\\n\\n\\n\"Come, Greater Being, Social Friend,\\n\\xa0\\xa0Annihilating Twelve-in-One!\\nWe long to die, for when we end,\\n\\xa0\\xa0Our larger life has but begun.\"\\n\\n\\nAgain twelve stanzas. By this time the soma had begun to work. Eyes\\nshone, cheeks were flushed, the inner light of universal benevolence broke out\\non every face in happy, friendly smiles. Even Bernard felt himself a little\\nmelted. When Morgana Rothschild turned and beamed at him, he did his best to\\nbeam back. But the eyebrow, that black two-in-one–alas, it was still there; he\\ncouldn\\'t ignore it, couldn\\'t, however hard he tried. The melting hadn\\'t gone\\nfar enough. Perhaps if he had been sitting between Fifi and Joanna … For the\\nthird time the loving cup went round; \"I drink to the imminence of His\\nComing,\" said Morgana Rothschild, whose turn it happened to be to initiate the\\ncircular rite. Her tone was loud, exultant. She drank and passed the cup to\\nBernard. \"I drink to the imminence of His Coming,\" he repeated, with a sincere\\nattempt to feel that the coming was imminent; but the eyebrow continued to\\nhaunt him, and the Coming, so far as he was concerned, was horribly remote. He\\ndrank and handed the cup to Clara Deterding. \"It\\'ll be a failure again,\" he\\nsaid to himself. \"I know it will.\" But he went on doing his best to beam.\\n\\n\\nThe loving cup had made its circuit. Lifting his hand, the President gave\\na signal; the chorus broke out into the third Solidarity Hymn.\\n\\n\\n\"Feel how the Greater Being comes!\\n\\xa0\\xa0Rejoice and, in rejoicings, die!\\nMelt in the music of the drums!\\n\\xa0\\xa0For I am you and you are I.\"\\n\\n\\nAs verse succeeded verse the voices thrilled with an ever intenser\\nexcitement. The sense of the Coming\\'s imminence was like an electric tension\\nin the air. The President switched off the music and, with the final note of\\nthe final stanza, there was absolute silence–the silence of stretched\\nexpectancy, quivering and creeping with a galvanic life. The President reached\\nout his hand; and suddenly a Voice, a deep strong Voice, more musical than any\\nmerely human voice, richer, warmer, more vibrant with love and yearning and\\ncompassion, a wonderful, mysterious, supernatural Voice spoke from above their\\nheads. Very slowly, \"Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford,\" it said diminishingly and on a\\ndescending scale. A sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the\\nsolar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened; tears\\ncame into their eyes; their hearts, their bowels seemed to move within them,\\nas though with an independent life. \"Ford!\" they were melting, \"Ford!\"\\ndissolved, dissolved. Then, in another tone, suddenly, startlingly. \"Listen!\"\\ntrumpeted the voice. \"Listen!\" They listened. After a pause, sunk to a\\nwhisper, but a whisper, somehow, more penetrating than the loudest cry. \"The\\nfeet of the Greater Being,\" it went on, and repeated the words: \"The feet of\\nthe Greater Being.\" The whisper almost expired. \"The feet of the Greater Being\\nare on the stairs.\" And once more there was silence; and the expectancy,\\nmomentarily relaxed, was stretched again, tauter, tauter, almost to the\\ntearing point. The feet of the Greater Being–oh, they heard them, they heard\\nthem, coming softly down the stairs, coming nearer and nearer down the\\ninvisible stairs. The feet of the Greater Being. And suddenly the tearing\\npoint was reached. Her eyes staring, her lips parted. Morgana Rothschild\\nsprang to her feet.\\n\\n\\n\"I hear him,\" she cried. \"I hear him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s coming,\" shouted Sarojini Engels.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'s coming, I hear him.\" Fifi Bradlaugh and Tom Kawaguchi rose\\nsimultaneously to their feet.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, oh!\" Joanna inarticulately testified.\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s coming!\" yelled Jim Bokanovsky.\\n\\n\\nThe President leaned forward and, with a touch, released a delirium of\\ncymbals and blown brass, a fever of tom-tomming.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s coming!\" screamed Clara Deterding. \"Aie!\" and it was as though\\nshe were having her throat cut.\\n\\n\\nFeeling that it was time for him to do something, Bernard also jumped up\\nand shouted: \"I hear him; He\\'s coming.\" But it wasn\\'t true. He heard nothing\\nand, for him, nobody was coming. Nobody–in spite of the music, in spite of the\\nmounting excitement. But he waved his arms, he shouted with the best of them;\\nand when the others began to jig and stamp and shuffle, he also jigged and\\nshuffled.\\n\\n\\nRound they went, a circular procession of dancers, each with hands on the\\nhips of the dancer preceding, round and round, shouting in unison, stamping to\\nthe rhythm of the music with their feet, beating it, beating it out with hands\\non the buttocks in front; twelve pairs of hands beating as one; as one, twelve\\nbuttocks slabbily resounding. Twelve as one, twelve as one. \"I hear Him, I\\nhear Him coming.\" The music quickened; faster beat the feet, faster, faster\\nfell the rhythmic hands. And all at once a great synthetic bass boomed out the\\nwords which announced the approaching atonement and final consummation of\\nsolidarity, the coming of the Twelve-in-One, the incarnation of the Greater\\nBeing. \"Orgy-porgy,\" it sang, while the tom-toms continued to beat their\\nfeverish tattoo:\\n\\n\\n\"Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun,\\nKiss the girls and make them One.\\nBoys at 0ne with girls at peace;\\nOrgy-porgy gives release.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Orgy-porgy,\" the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain, \"Orgy-porgy,\\nFord and fun, kiss the girls …\" And as they sang, the lights began slowly to\\nfade–to fade and at the same time to grow warmer, richer, redder, until at\\nlast they were dancing in the crimson twilight of an Embryo Store. \"Orgy-porgy\\n…\" In their blood-coloured and foetal darkness the dancers continued for a\\nwhile to circulate, to beat and beat out the indefatigable rhythm. \"Orgy-porgy\\n…\" Then the circle wavered, broke, fell in partial disintegration on the ring\\nof couches which surrounded–circle enclosing circle–the table and its\\nplanetary chairs. \"Orgy-porgy …\" Tenderly the deep Voice crooned and cooed; in\\nthe red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering\\nbenevolently over the now prone or supine dancers.\\n\\n\\nThey were standing on the roof; Big Henry had just sung eleven. The night\\nwas calm and warm.\\n\\n\\n\"Wasn\\'t it wonderful?\" said Fifi Bradlaugh. \"Wasn\\'t it simply wonderful?\"\\nShe looked at Bernard with an expression of rapture, but of rapture in which\\nthere was no trace of agitation or excitement–for to be excited is still to be\\nunsatisfied. Hers was the calm ecstasy of achieved consummation, the peace,\\nnot of mere vacant satiety and nothingness, but of balanced life, of energies\\nat rest and in equilibrium. A rich and living peace. For the Solidarity\\nService had given as well as taken, drawn off only to replenish. She was full,\\nshe was made perfect, she was still more than merely herself. \"Didn\\'t you\\nthink it was wonderful?\" she insisted, looking into Bernard\\'s face with those\\nsupernaturally shining eyes.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I thought it was wonderful,\" he lied and looked away; the sight of\\nher transfigured face was at once an accusation and an ironical reminder of\\nhis own separateness. He was as miserably isolated now as he had been when the\\nservice began–more isolated by reason of his unreplenished emptiness, his dead\\nsatiety. Separate and unatoned, while the others were being fused into the\\nGreater Being; alone even in Morgana\\'s embrace–much more alone, indeed, more\\nhopelessly himself than he had ever been in his life before. He had emerged\\nfrom that crimson twilight into the common electric glare with a\\nself-consciousness intensified to the pitch of agony. He was utterly\\nmiserable, and perhaps (her shining eyes accused him), perhaps it was his own\\nfault. \"Quite wonderful,\" he repeated; but the only thing he could think of\\nwas Morgana\\'s eyebrow.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4\\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}',\n",

So odd, indeed, that in the course of the succeeding weeks she had\\nwondered more than once whether she shouldn\\'t change her mind about the New\\nMexico holiday, and go instead to the North Pole with Benito Hoover. The\\ntrouble was that she knew the North Pole, had been there with George Edzel\\nonly last summer, and what was more, found it pretty grim. Nothing to do, and\\nthe hotel too hopelessly old-fashioned–no television laid on in the bedrooms,\\nno scent organ, only the most putrid synthetic music, and not more than\\ntwenty-five Escalator-Squash Courts for over two hundred guests. No, decidedly\\nshe couldn\\'t face the North Pole again. Added to which, she had only been to\\nAmerica once before. And even then, how inadequately! A cheap week-end in New\\nYork–had it been with Jean-Jacques Habibullah or Bokanovsky Jones? She\\ncouldn\\'t remember. Anyhow, it was of absolutely no importance. The prospect of\\nflying West again, and for a whole week, was very inviting. Moreover, for at\\nleast three days of that week they would be in the Savage Reservation. Not\\nmore than half a dozen people in the whole Centre had ever been inside a\\nSavage Reservation. As an Alpha-Plus psychologist, Bernard was one of the few\\nmen she knew entitled to a permit. For Lenina, the opportunity was unique. And\\nyet, so unique also was Bernard\\'s oddness that she had hesitated to take it,\\nhad actually thought of risking the Pole again with funny old Benito. At least\\nBenito was normal. Whereas Bernard …\\n\\n\"Alcohol in his blood-surrogate,\" was Fanny\\'s explanation of every\\neccentricity. But Henry, with whom, one evening when they were in bed\\ntogether, Lenina had rather anxiously discussed her new lover, Henry had\\ncompared poor Bernard to a rhinoceros.\\n\\n\\n\"You can\\'t teach a rhinoceros tricks,\" he had explained in his brief and\\nvigorous style. \"Some men are almost rhinoceroses; they don\\'t respond properly\\nto conditioning. Poor Devils! Bernard\\'s one of them. Luckily for him, he\\'s\\npretty good at his job. Otherwise the Director would never have kept him.\\nHowever,\" he added consolingly, \"I think he\\'s pretty harmless.\"\\n\\n\\nPretty harmless, perhaps; but also pretty disquieting. That mania, to\\nstart with, for doing things in private. Which meant, in practice, not doing\\nanything at all. For what was there that one could do in private.\\n(Apart, of course, from going to bed: but one couldn\\'t do that all the time.)\\nYes, what was there? Precious little. The first afternoon they went out\\ntogether was particularly fine. Lenina had suggested a swim at Toquay Country\\nClub followed by dinner at the Oxford Union. But Bernard thought there would\\nbe too much of a crowd. Then what about a round of Electro-magnetic Golf at\\nSt. Andrew\\'s? But again, no: Bernard considered that Electro-magnetic Golf was\\na waste of time.\\n\\n\\n\"Then what\\'s time for?\" asked Lenina in some astonishment.\\n\\n\\nApparently, for going walks in the Lake District; for that was what he now\\nproposed. Land on the top of Skiddaw and walk for a couple of hours in the\\nheather. \"Alone with you, Lenina.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, Bernard, we shall be alone all night.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard blushed and looked away. \"I meant, alone for talking,\" he mumbled.\\n\\n\\n\"Talking? But what about?\" Walking and talking–that seemed a very odd way\\nof spending an afternoon.\\n\\n\\nIn the end she persuaded him, much against his will, to fly over to\\nAmsterdam to see the Semi-Demi-Finals of the Women\\'s Heavyweight Wrestling\\nChampionship.\\n\\n\\n\"In a crowd,\" he grumbled. \"As usual.\" He remained obstinately gloomy the\\nwhole afternoon; wouldn\\'t talk to Lenina\\'s friends (of whom they met dozens in\\nthe ice-cream soma bar between the wrestling bouts); and in spite of\\nhis misery absolutely refused to take the half-gramme raspberry sundae which\\nshe pressed upon him. \"I\\'d rather be myself,\" he said. \"Myself and nasty. Not\\nsomebody else, however jolly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"A gramme in time saves nine,\" said Lenina, producing a bright treasure of\\nsleep-taught wisdom. Bernard pushed away the proffered glass impatiently.\\n\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t lose your temper,\" she said. \"Remember one cubic centimetre\\ncures ten gloomy sentiments.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, for Ford\\'s sake, be quiet!\" he shouted.\\n\\n\\nLenina shrugged her shoulders. \"A gramme is always better than a damn,\"\\nshe concluded with dignity, and drank the sundae herself.\\n\\n\\nOn their way back across the Channel, Bernard insisted on stopping his\\npropeller and hovering on his helicopter screws within a hundred feet of the\\nwaves. The weather had taken a change for the worse; a south-westerly wind had\\nsprung up, the sky was cloudy.\\n\\n\\n\"Look,\" he commanded.\\n\\n\\n\"But it\\'s horrible,\" said Lenina, shrinking back from the window. She was\\nappalled by the rushing emptiness of the night, by the black foam-flecked\\nwater heaving beneath them, by the pale face of the moon, so haggard and\\ndistracted among the hastening clouds. \"Let\\'s turn on the radio. Quick!\" She\\nreached for the dialling knob on the dash-board and turned it at random.\\n\\n\\n\"… skies are blue inside of you,\" sang sixteen tremoloing falsettos, \"the\\nweather\\'s always …\"\\n\\n\\nThen a hiccough and silence. Bernard had switched off the current.\\n\\n\\n\"I want to look at the sea in peace,\" he said. \"One can\\'t even look with\\nthat beastly noise going on.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But it\\'s lovely. And I don\\'t want to look.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I do,\" he insisted. \"It makes me feel as though …\" he hesitated,\\nsearching for words with which to express himself, \"as though I were more\\nme, if you see what I mean. More on my own, not so completely a part of\\nsomething else. Not just a cell in the social body. Doesn\\'t it make you feel\\nlike that, Lenina?\"\\n\\n\\nBut Lenina was crying. \"It\\'s horrible, it\\'s horrible,\" she kept repeating.\\n\"And how can you talk like that about not wanting to be a part of the social\\nbody? After all, every one works for every one else. We can\\'t do without any\\none. Even Epsilons …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Bernard derisively. \"\\'Even Epsilons are useful\\'! So am\\nI. And I damned well wish I weren\\'t!\"\\n\\n\\nLenina was shocked by his blasphemy. \"Bernard!\" She protested in a voice\\nof amazed distress. \"How can you?\"\\n\\n\\nIn a different key, \"How can I?\" he repeated meditatively. \"No, the real\\nproblem is: How is it that I can\\'t, or rather–because, after all, I know quite\\nwell why I can\\'t–what would it be like if I could, if I were free–not enslaved\\nby my conditioning.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, Bernard, you\\'re saying the most awful things.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you wish you were free, Lenina?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean. I am free. Free to have the most wonderful\\ntime. Everybody\\'s happy nowadays.\"\\n\\n\\nHe laughed, \"Yes, \\'Everybody\\'s happy nowadays.\\' We begin giving the\\nchildren that at five. But wouldn\\'t you like to be free to be happy in some\\nother way, Lenina? In your own way, for example; not in everybody else\\'s way.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" she repeated. Then, turning to him, \"Oh, do\\nlet\\'s go back, Bernard,\" she besought; \"I do so hate it here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you like being with me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"But of course, Bernard. It\\'s this horrible place.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I thought we\\'d be more … more together here–with nothing but the\\nsea and moon. More together than in that crowd, or even in my rooms. Don\\'t you\\nunderstand that?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand anything,\" she said with decision, determined to\\npreserve her incomprehension intact. \"Nothing. Least of all,\" she continued in\\nanother tone \"why you don\\'t take soma when you have these dreadful\\nideas of yours. You\\'d forget all about them. And instead of feeling miserable,\\nyou\\'d be jolly. So jolly,\" she repeated and smiled, for all the puzzled\\nanxiety in her eyes, with what was meant to be an inviting and voluptuous\\ncajolery.\\n\\n\\nHe looked at her in silence, his face unresponsive and very grave–looked\\nat her intently. After a few seconds Lenina\\'s eyes flinched away; she uttered\\na nervous little laugh, tried to think of something to say and couldn\\'t. The\\nsilence prolonged itself.\\n\\n\\nWhen Bernard spoke at last, it was in a small tired voice. \"All right\\nthen,\" he said, \"we\\'ll go back.\" And stepping hard on the accelerator, he sent\\nthe machine rocketing up into the sky. At four thousand he started his\\npropeller. They flew in silence for a minute or two. Then, suddenly, Bernard\\nbegan to laugh. Rather oddly, Lenina thought, but still, it was laughter.\\n\\n\\n\"Feeling better?\" she ventured to ask.\\n\\n\\nFor answer, he lifted one hand from the controls and, slipping his arm\\naround her, began to fondle her breasts.\\n\\n\\n\"Thank Ford,\" she said to herself, \"he\\'s all right again.\"\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later they were back in his rooms. Bernard swallowed four\\ntablets of soma at a gulp, turned on the radio and television and began\\nto undress.\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" Lenina enquired, with significant archness when they met next\\nafternoon on the roof, \"did you think it was fun yesterday?\"\\n\\n\\nBernard nodded. They climbed into the plane. A little jolt, and they were\\noff.\\n\\n\\n\"Every one says I\\'m awfully pneumatic,\" said Lenina reflectively, patting\\nher own legs.\\n\\n\\n\"Awfully.\" But there was an expression of pain in Bernard\\'s eyes. \"Like\\nmeat,\" he was thinking.\\n\\n\\nShe looked up with a certain anxiety. \"But you don\\'t think I\\'m too\\nplump, do you?\"\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head. Like so much meat.\\n\\n\\n\"You think I\\'m all right.\" Another nod. \"In every way?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Perfect,\" he said aloud. And inwardly. \"She thinks of herself that way.\\nShe doesn\\'t mind being meat.\"\\n\\n\\nLenina smiled triumphantly. But her satisfaction was premature.\\n\\n\\n\"All the same,\" he went on, after a little pause, \"I still rather wish it\\nhad all ended differently.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Differently?\" Were there other endings?\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t want it to end with our going to bed,\" he specified.\\n\\n\\nLenina was astonished.\\n\\n\\n\"Not at once, not the first day.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But then what …?\"\\n\\n\\nHe began to talk a lot of incomprehensible and dangerous nonsense. Lenina\\ndid her best to stop the ears of her mind; but every now and then a phrase\\nwould insist on becoming audible. \"… to try the effect of arresting my\\nimpulses,\" she heard him say. The words seemed to touch a spring in her mind.\\n\\n\\n\"Never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have to-day,\" she said\\ngravely.\\n\\n\\n\"Two hundred repetitions, twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a\\nhalf,\" was all his comment. The mad bad talk rambled on. \"I want to know what\\npassion is,\" she heard him saying. \"I want to feel something strongly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"When the individual feels, the community reels,\" Lenina pronounced.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, why shouldn\\'t it reel a bit?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Bernard!\"\\n\\n\\nBut Bernard remained unabashed.\\n\\n\\n\"Adults intellectually and during working hours,\" he went on. \"Infants\\nwhere feeling and desire are concerned.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Our Ford loved infants.\"\\n\\n\\nIgnoring the interruption. \"It suddenly struck me the other day,\"\\ncontinued Bernard, \"that it might be possible to be an adult all the time.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand.\" Lenina\\'s tone was firm.\\n\\n\\n\"I know you don\\'t. And that\\'s why we went to bed together yesterday–like\\ninfants–instead of being adults and waiting.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But it was fun,\" Lenina insisted. \"Wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, the greatest fun,\" he answered, but in a voice so mournful, with an\\nexpression so profoundly miserable, that Lenina felt all her triumph suddenly\\nevaporate. Perhaps he had found her too plump, after all.\\n\\n\\n\"I told you so,\" was all that Fanny said, when Lenina came and made her\\nconfidences. \"It\\'s the alcohol they put in his surrogate.\"\\n\\n\\n\"All the same,\" Lenina insisted. \"I do like him. He has such awfully nice\\nhands. And the way he moves his shoulders–that\\'s very attractive.\" She sighed.\\n\"But I wish he weren\\'t so odd.\"\\n\\n§ 2\\nHALTING for a moment outside the door of the Director\\'s\\nroom, Bernard drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders, bracing himself to\\nmeet the dislike and disapproval which he was certain of finding within. He\\nknocked and entered.\\n\\n\"A permit for you to initial, Director,\" he said as airily as possible,\\nand laid the paper on the writing-table.\\n\\n\\nThe Director glanced at him sourly. But the stamp of the World\\nController\\'s Office was at the head of the paper and the signature of Mustapha\\nMond, bold and black, across the bottom. Everything was perfectly in order.\\nThe director had no choice. He pencilled his initials–two small pale letters\\nabject at the feet of Mustapha Mond–and was about to return the paper without\\na word of comment or genial Ford-speed, when his eye was caught by something\\nwritten in the body of the permit.\\n\\n\\n\"For the New Mexican Reservation?\" he said, and his tone, the face he\\nlifted to Bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment.\\n\\n\\nSurprised by his surprise, Bernard nodded. There was a silence.\\n\\n\\nThe Director leaned back in his chair, frowning. \"How long ago was it?\" he\\nsaid, speaking more to himself than to Bernard. \"Twenty years, I suppose.\\nNearer twenty-five. I must have been your age …\" He sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n\\nBernard felt extremely uncomfortable. A man so conventional, so\\nscrupulously correct as the Director–and to commit so gross a solecism! lt\\nmade him want to hide his face, to run out of the room. Not that he himself\\nsaw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote\\npast; that was one of those hypnopædic prejudices he had (so he imagined)\\ncompletely got rid of. What made him feel shy was the knowledge that the\\nDirector disapproved–disapproved and yet had been betrayed into doing the\\nforbidden thing. Under what inward compulsion? Through his discomfort Bernard\\neagerly listened.\\n\\n\\n\"I had the same idea as you,\" the Director was saying. \"Wanted to have a\\nlook at the savages. Got a permit for New Mexico and went there for my summer\\nholiday. With the girl I was having at the moment. She was a Beta-Minus, and I\\nthink\" (he shut his eyes), \"I think she had yellow hair. Anyhow she was\\npneumatic, particularly pneumatic; I remember that. Well, we went there, and\\nwe looked at the savages, and we rode about on horses and all that. And\\nthen–it was almost the last day of my leave–then … well, she got lost. We\\'d\\ngone riding up one of those revolting mountains, and it was horribly hot and\\noppressive, and after lunch we went to sleep. Or at least I did. She must have\\ngone for a walk, alone. At any rate, when I woke up, she wasn\\'t there. And the\\nmost frightful thunderstorm I\\'ve ever seen was just bursting on us. And it\\npoured and roared and flashed; and the horses broke loose and ran away; and I\\nfell down, trying to catch them, and hurt my knee, so that I could hardly\\nwalk. Still, I searched and I shouted and I searched. But there was no sign of\\nher. Then I thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. So I\\ncrawled down into the valley by the way we had come. My knee was agonizingly\\npainful, and I\\'d lost my soma. It took me hours. I didn\\'t get back to\\nthe rest-house till after midnight. And she wasn\\'t there; she wasn\\'t there,\"\\nthe Director repeated. There was a silence. \"Well,\" he resumed at last, \"the\\nnext day there was a search. But we couldn\\'t find her. She must have fallen\\ninto a gully somewhere; or been eaten by a mountain lion. Ford knows. Anyhow\\nit was horrible. It upset me very much at the time. More than it ought to have\\ndone, I dare say. Because, after all, it\\'s the sort of accident that might\\nhave happened to any one; and, of course, the social body persists although\\nthe component cells may change.\" But this sleep-taught consolation did not\\nseem to be very effective. Shaking his head, \"I actually dream about it\\nsometimes,\" the Director went on in a low voice. \"Dream of being woken up by\\nthat peal of thunder and finding her gone; dream of searching and searching\\nfor her under the trees.\" He lapsed into the silence of reminiscence.\\n\\n\\n\"You must have had a terrible shock,\" said Bernard, almost enviously.\\n\\n\\nAt the sound of his voice the Director started into a guilty realization\\nof where he was; shot a glance at Bernard, and averting his eyes, blushed\\ndarkly; looked at him again with sudden suspicion and, angrily on his dignity,\\n\"Don\\'t imagine,\" he said, \"that I\\'d had any indecorous relation with the girl.\\nNothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. It was all perfectly healthy and\\nnormal.\" He handed Bernard the permit. \"I really don\\'t know why I bored you\\nwith this trivial anecdote.\" Furious with himself for having given away a\\ndiscreditable secret, he vented his rage on Bernard. The look in his eyes was\\nnow frankly malignant. \"And I should like to take this opportunity, Mr. Marx,\"\\nhe went on, \"of saying that I\\'m not at all pleased with the reports I receive\\nof your behaviour outside working hours. You may say that this is not my\\nbusiness. But it is. I have the good name of the Centre to think of. My\\nworkers must be above suspicion, particularly those of the highest castes.\\nAlphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in\\ntheir emotional behaviour. But that is all the more reason for their making a\\nspecial effort to conform. lt is their duty to be infantile, even against\\ntheir inclination. And so, Mr. Marx, I give you fair warning.\" The Director\\'s\\nvoice vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous and\\nimpersonal–was the expression of the disapproval of Society itself. \"If ever I\\nhear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile decorum, I shall\\nask for your transference to a Sub-Centre–preferably to Iceland. Good\\nmorning.\" And swivelling round in his chair, he picked up his pen and began to\\nwrite.\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'ll teach him,\" he said to himself. But he was mistaken. For Bernard\\nleft the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in\\nthe thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated\\nby the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and\\nimportance. Even the thought of persecution left him undismayed, was rather\\ntonic than depressing. He felt strong enough to meet and overcome affliction,\\nstrong enough to face even Iceland. And this confidence was the greater for\\nhis not for a moment really believing that he would be called upon to face\\nanything at all. People simply weren\\'t transferred for things like that.\\nIceland was just a threat. A most stimulating and life-giving threat. Walking\\nalong the corridor, he actually whistled.\\n\\n\\nHeroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the\\nD.H.C. \"Whereupon,\" it concluded, \"I simply told him to go to the Bottomless\\nPast and marched out of the room. And that was that.\" He looked at Helmholtz\\nWatson expectantly, awaiting his due reward of sympathy, encouragement,\\nadmiration. But no word came. Helmholtz sat silent, staring at the floor.\\n\\n\\nHe liked Bernard; he was grateful to him for being the only man of his\\nacquaintance with whom he could talk about the subjects he felt to be\\nimportant. Nevertheless, there were things in Bernard which he hated. This\\nboasting, for example. And the outbursts of an abject self-pity with which it\\nalternated. And his deplorable habit of being bold after the event, and full,\\nin absence, of the most extraordinary presence of mind. He hated these\\nthings–just because he liked Bernard. The seconds passed. Helmholtz continued\\nto stare at the floor. And suddenly Bernard blushed and turned away.\\n\\n§ 3\\nTHE journey was quite uneventful. The Blue Pacific\\nRocket was two and a half minutes early at New Orleans, lost four minutes in a\\ntornado over Texas, but flew into a favourable air current at Longitude 95\\nWest, and was able to land at Santa Fé less than forty seconds behind schedule\\ntime.\\n\\n\"Forty seconds on a six and a half hour flight. Not so bad,\" Lenina\\nconceded.\\n\\n\\nThey slept that night at Santa Fé. The hotel was excellent–incomparably\\nbetter, for example, than that horrible Aurora Bora Palace in which Lenina had\\nsuffered so much the previous summer. Liquid air, television, vibro-vacuum\\nmassage, radio, boiling caffeine solution, hot contraceptives, and eight\\ndifferent kinds of scent were laid on in every bedroom. The synthetic music\\nplant was working as they entered the hall and left nothing to be desired. A\\nnotice in the lift announced that there were sixty Escalator-Squash-Racket\\nCourts in the hotel, and that Obstacle and Electro-magnetic Golf could both be\\nplayed in the park.\\n\\n\\n\"But it sounds simply too lovely,\" cried Lenina. \"I almost wish we could\\nstay here. Sixty Escalator-Squash Courts …\"\\n\\n\\n\"There won\\'t be any in the Reservation,\" Bernard warned her. \"And no\\nscent, no television, no hot water even. If you feel you can\\'t stand it, stay\\nhere till I come back.\"\\n\\n\\nLenina was quite offended. \"Of course I can stand it. I only said it was\\nlovely here because … well, because progress is lovely, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,\" said\\nBernard wearily, as though to himself.\\n\\n\\n\"What did you say?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I said that progress was lovely. That\\'s why you mustn\\'t come to the\\nReservation unless you really want to.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I do want to.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Very well, then,\" said Bernard; and it was almost a threat.\\n\\n\\nTheir permit required the signature of the Warden of the Reservation, at\\nwhose office next morning they duly presented themselves. An Epsilon-Plus\\nnegro porter took in Bernard\\'s card, and they were admitted almost\\nimmediately.\\n\\n\\nThe Warden was a blond and brachycephalic Alpha-Minus, short, red,\\nmoon-faced, and broad-shouldered, with a loud booming voice, very well adapted\\nto the utterance of hypnopædic wisdom. He was a mine of irrelevant information\\nand unasked-for good advice. Once started, he went on and on–boomingly.\\n\\n\\n\"… five hundred and sixty thousand square kilometres, divided into four\\ndistinct Sub-Reservations, each surrounded by a high-tension wire fence.\"\\n\\n\\nAt this moment, and for no apparent reason, Bernard suddenly remembered\\nthat he had left the Eau de Cologne tap in his bathroom wide open and running.\\n\\n\\n\"… supplied with current from the Grand Canyon hydro-electric station.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Cost me a fortune by the time I get back.\" With his mind\\'s eye, Bernard\\nsaw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round, antlike,\\nindefatigable. \"Quickly telephone to Helmholtz Watson.\"\\n\\n\\n\"… upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand\\nvolts.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so,\" said Lenina politely, not knowing in the least what\\nthe Warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. When the\\nWarden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed half a gramme of\\nsoma, with the result that she could now sit, serenely not listening,\\nthinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue eyes fixed on the Warden\\'s\\nface in an expression of rapt attention.\\n\\n\\n\"To touch the fence is instant death,\" pronounced the Warden solemnly.\\n\"There is no escape from a Savage Reservation.\"\\n\\n\\nThe word \"escape\" was suggestive. \"Perhaps,\" said Bernard, half rising,\\n\"we ought to think of going.\" The little black needle was scurrying, an\\ninsect, nibbling through time, eating into his money.\\n\\n\\n\"No escape,\" repeated the Warden, waving him back into his chair; and as\\nthe permit was not yet countersigned Bernard had no choice but to obey. \"Those\\nwho are born in the Reservation–and remember, my dear young lady,\" he added,\\nleering obscenely at Lenina, and speaking in an improper whisper, \"remember\\nthat, in the Reservation, children still are born, yes, actually born,\\nrevolting as that may seem …\" (He hoped that this reference to a shameful\\nsubject would make Lenina blush; but she only smiled with simulated\\nintelligence and said, \"You don\\'t say so!\" Disappointed, the Warden began\\nagain. ) \"Those, I repeat who are born in the Reservation are destined to die\\nthere.\"\\n\\n\\nDestined to die … A decilitre of Eau de Cologne every minute. Six litres\\nan hour. \"Perhaps,\" Bernard tried again, \"we ought …\"\\n\\n\\nLeaning forward, the Warden tapped the table with his forefinger. \"You ask\\nme how many people live in the Reservation. And I reply\"–triumphantly–\"I reply\\nthat we do not know. We can only guess.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so.\"\\n\\n\\n\"My dear young lady, I do say so.\"\\n\\n\\nSix times twenty-four–no, it would be nearer six times thirty-six. Bernard\\nwas pale and trembling with impatience. But inexorably the booming continued.\\n\\n\\n\"… about sixty thousand Indians and half-breeds … absolute savages … our\\ninspectors occasionally visit … otherwise, no communication whatever with the\\ncivilized world … still preserve their repulsive habits and customs …\\nmarriage, if you know what that is, my dear young lady; families … no\\nconditioning … monstrous superstitions … Christianity and totemism and\\nancestor worship … extinct languages, such as Zuñi and Spanish and Athapascan\\n… pumas, porcupines and other ferocious animals … infectious diseases …\\npriests … venomous lizards …\"\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so?\"\\n\\n\\nThey got away at last. Bernard dashed to the telephone. Quick, quick; but\\nit took him nearly three minutes to get on to Helmholtz Watson. \"We might be\\namong the savages already,\" he complained. \"Damned incompetence!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Have a gramme,\" suggested Lenina.\\n\\n\\nHe refused, preferring his anger. And at last, thank Ford, he was through\\nand, yes, it was Helmholtz; Helmholtz, to whom he explained what had happened,\\nand who promised to go round at once, at once, and turn off the tap, yes, at\\nonce, but took this opportunity to tell him what the D.H.C. had said, in\\npublic, yesterday evening …\\n\\n\\n\"What? He\\'s looking out for some one to take my place?\" Bernard\\'s voice\\nwas agonized. \"So it\\'s actually decided? Did he mention Iceland? You say he\\ndid? Ford! Iceland …\" He hung up the receiver and turned back to Lenina. His\\nface was pale, his expression utterly dejected.\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n\"The matter?\" He dropped heavily into a chair. \"I\\'m going to be sent to\\nIceland.\"\\n\\n\\nOften in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be subjected\\n(soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to rely on) to\\nsome great trial, some pain, some persecution; he had even longed for\\naffliction. As recently as a week ago, in the Director\\'s office, he had\\nimagined himself courageously resisting, stoically accepting suffering without\\na word. The Director\\'s threats had actually elated him, made him feel larger\\nthan life. But that, as he now realized, was because he had not taken the\\nthreats quite seriously, he had not believed that, when it came to the point,\\nthe D.H.C. would ever do anything. Now that it looked as though the threats\\nwere really to be fulfilled, Bernard was appalled. Of that imagined stoicism,\\nthat theoretical courage, not a trace was left.\\n\\n\\nHe raged against himself–what a fool!–against the Director–how unfair not\\nto give him that other chance, that other chance which, he now had no doubt at\\nall, he had always intended to take. And Iceland, Iceland …\\n\\n\\nLenina shook her head. \"Was and will make me ill,\" she quoted, \"I take a\\ngramme and only am.\"\\n\\n\\nIn the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. Five\\nminutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present\\nrosily blossomed. A message from the porter announced that, at the Warden\\'s\\norders, a Reservation Guard had come round with a plane and was waiting on the\\nroof of the hotel. They went up at once. An octoroon in Gamma-green uniform\\nsaluted and proceeded to recite the morning\\'s programme.\\n\\n\\nA bird\\'s-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos, then a\\nlanding for lunch in the valley of Malpais. The rest-house was comfortable\\nthere, and up at the pueblo the savages would probably be celebrating their\\nsummer festival. It would be the best place to spend the night.\\n\\n\\nThey took their seats in the plane and set off. Ten minutes later they\\nwere crossing the frontier that separated civilization from savagery. Uphill\\nand down, across the deserts of salt or sand, through forests, into the violet\\ndepth of canyons, over crag and peak and table-topped mesa, the fence marched\\non and on, irresistibly the straight line, the geometrical symbol of\\ntriumphant human purpose. And at its foot, here and there, a mosaic of white\\nbones, a still unrotted carcase dark on the tawny ground marked the place\\nwhere deer or steer, puma or porcupine or coyote, or the greedy turkey\\nbuzzards drawn down by the whiff of carrion and fulminated as though by a\\npoetic justice, had come too close to the destroying wires.\\n\\n\\n\"They never learn,\" said the green-uniformed pilot, pointing down at the\\nskeletons on the ground below them. \"And they never will learn,\" he added and\\nlaughed, as though he had somehow scored a personal triumph over the\\nelectrocuted animals.\\n\\n\\nBernard also laughed; after two grammes of soma the joke seemed,\\nfor some reason, good. Laughed and then, almost immediately, dropped off to\\nsleep, and sleeping was carried over Taos and Tesuque; over Nambe and Picuris\\nand Pojoaque, over Sia and Cochiti, over Laguna and Acoma and the Enchanted\\nMesa, over Zuñi and Cibola and Ojo Caliente, and woke at last to find the\\nmachine standing on the ground, Lenina carrying the suit-cases into a small\\nsquare house, and the Gamma-green octoroon talking incomprehensibly with a\\nyoung Indian.\\n\\n\\n\"Malpais,\" explained the pilot, as Bernard stepped out. \"This is the\\nrest-house. And there\\'s a dance this afternoon at the pueblo. He\\'ll take you\\nthere.\" He pointed to the sullen young savage. \"Funny, I expect.\" He grinned.\\n\"Everything they do is funny.\" And with that he climbed into the plane and\\nstarted up the engines. \"Back to-morrow.

The channel wound between precipitous banks, and slanting\\nfrom one wall to the other across the valley ran a streak of green-the river\\nand its fields. On the prow of that stone ship in the centre of the strait,\\nand seemingly a part of it, a shaped and geometrical outcrop of the naked\\nrock, stood the pueblo of Malpais. Block above block, each story smaller than\\nthe one below, the tall houses rose like stepped and amputated pyramids into\\nthe blue sky. At their feet lay a straggle of low buildings, a criss-cross of\\nwalls; and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into the plain. A few\\ncolumns of smoke mounted perpendicularly into the windless air and were\\nlost.\\n\\n\"Queer,\" said Lenina. \"Very queer.\" It was her ordinary word of\\ncondemnation. \"I don\\'t like it. And I don\\'t like that man.\" She pointed to the\\nIndian guide who had been appointed to take them up to the pueblo. Her feeling\\nwas evidently reciprocated; the very back of the man, as he walked along\\nbefore them, was hostile, sullenly contemptuous.\\n\\n\\n\"Besides,\" she lowered her voice, \"he smells.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard did not attempt to deny it. They walked on.\\n\\n\\nSuddenly it was as though the whole air had come alive and were pulsing,\\npulsing with the indefatigable movement of blood. Up there, in Malpais, the\\ndrums were being beaten. Their feet fell in with the rhythm of that mysterious\\nheart; they quickened their pace. Their path led them to the foot of the\\nprecipice. The sides of the great mesa ship towered over them, three hundred\\nfeet to the gunwale.\\n\\n\\n\"I wish we could have brought the plane,\" said Lenina, looking up\\nresentfully at the blank impending rock-face. \"I hate walking. And you feel so\\nsmall when you\\'re on the ground at the bottom of a hill.\"\\n\\n\\nThey walked along for some way in the shadow of the mesa, rounded a\\nprojection, and there, in a water-worn ravine, was the way up the companion\\nladder. They climbed. It was a very steep path that zigzagged from side to\\nside of the gully. Sometimes the pulsing of the drums was all but inaudible,\\nat others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner.\\n\\n\\nWhen they were half-way up, an eagle flew past so close to them that the\\nwind of his wings blew chill on their faces. In a crevice of the rock lay a\\npile of bones. It was all oppressively queer, and the Indian smelt stronger\\nand stronger. They emerged at last from the ravine into the full sunlight. The\\ntop of the mesa was a flat deck of stone.\\n\\n\\n\"Like the Charing-T Tower,\" was Lenina\\'s comment. But she was not allowed\\nto enjoy her discovery of this reassuring resemblance for long. A padding of\\nsoft feet made them turn round. Naked from throat to navel, their dark brown\\nbodies painted with white lines (\"like asphalt tennis courts,\" Lenina was\\nlater to explain), their faces inhuman with daubings of scarlet, black and\\nochre, two Indians came running along the path. Their black hair was braided\\nwith fox fur and red flannel. Cloaks of turkey feathers fluttered from their\\nshoulders; huge feather diadems exploded gaudily round their heads. With every\\nstep they took came the clink and rattle of their silver bracelets, their\\nheavy necklaces of bone and turquoise beads. They came on without a word,\\nrunning quietly in their deerskin moccasins. One of them was holding a feather\\nbrush; the other carried, in either hand, what looked at a distance like three\\nor four pieces of thick rope. One of the ropes writhed uneasily, and suddenly\\nLenina saw that they were snakes.\\n\\n\\nThe men came nearer and nearer; their dark eyes looked at her, but without\\ngiving any sign of recognition, any smallest sign that they had seen her or\\nwere aware of her existence. The writhing snake hung limp again with the rest.\\nThe men passed.\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like it,\" said Lenina. \"I don\\'t like it.\"\\n\\n\\nShe liked even less what awaited her at the entrance to the pueblo, where\\ntheir guide had left them while he went inside for instructions. The dirt, to\\nstart with, the piles of rubbish, the dust, the dogs, the flies. Her face\\nwrinkled up into a grimace of disgust. She held her handkerchief to her nose.\\n\\n\\n\"But how can they live like this?\" she broke out in a voice of indignant\\nincredulity. (It wasn\\'t possible.)\\n\\n\\nBernard shrugged his shoulders philosophically. \"Anyhow,\" he said,\\n\"they\\'ve been doing it for the last five or six thousand years. So I suppose\\nthey must be used to it by now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But cleanliness is next to fordliness,\" she insisted.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and civilization is sterilization,\" Bernard went on, concluding on a\\ntone of irony the second hypnopædic lesson in elementary hygiene. \"But these\\npeople have never heard of Our Ford, and they aren\\'t civilized. So there\\'s no\\npoint in …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" She gripped his arm. \"Look.\"\\n\\n\\nAn almost naked Indian was very slowly climbing down the ladder from the\\nfirst-floor terrace of a neighboring house–rung after rung, with the tremulous\\ncaution of extreme old age. His face was profoundly wrinkled and black, like a\\nmask of obsidian. The toothless mouth had fallen in. At the corners of the\\nlips, and on each side of the chin, a few long bristles gleamed almost white\\nagainst the dark skin. The long unbraided hair hung down in grey wisps round\\nhis face. His body was bent and emaciated to the bone, almost fleshless. Very\\nslowly he came down, pausing at each rung before he ventured another step.\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with him?\" whispered Lenina. Her eyes were wide with\\nhorror and amazement.\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s old, that\\'s all,\" Bernard answered as carelessly as he could. He too\\nwas startled; but he made an effort to seem unmoved.\\n\\n\\n\"Old?\" she repeated. \"But the Director\\'s old; lots of people are old;\\nthey\\'re not like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s because we don\\'t allow them to be like that. We preserve them from\\ndiseases. We keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at a\\nyouthful equilibrium. We don\\'t permit their magnesium-calcium ratio to fall\\nbelow what it was at thirty. We give them transfusion of young blood. We keep\\ntheir metabolism permanently stimulated. So, of course, they don\\'t look like\\nthat. Partly,\" he added, \"because most of them die long before they reach this\\nold creature\\'s age. Youth almost unimpaired till sixty, and then, crack! the\\nend.\"\\n\\n\\nBut Lenina was not listening. She was watching the old man. Slowly, slowly\\nhe came down. His feet touched the ground. He turned. In their deep-sunken\\norbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. They looked at her for a\\nlong moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been\\nthere at all. Then slowly, with bent back the old man hobbled past them and\\nwas gone.\\n\\n\\n\"But it\\'s terrible,\" Lenina whispered. \"It\\'s awful. We ought not to have\\ncome here.\" She felt in her pocket for her soma–only to discover that,\\nby some unprecedented oversight, she had left the bottle down at the\\nrest-house. Bernard\\'s pockets were also empty.\\n\\n\\nLenina was left to face the horrors of Malpais unaided. They came crowding\\nin on her thick and fast. The spectacle of two young women giving breast to\\ntheir babies made her blush and turn away her face. She had never seen\\nanything so indecent in her life. And what made it worse was that, instead of\\ntactfully ignoring it, Bernard proceeded to make open comments on this\\nrevoltingly viviparous scene. Ashamed, now that the effects of the soma\\nhad worn off, of the weakness he had displayed that morning in the hotel, he\\nwent out of his way to show himself strong and unorthodox.\\n\\n\\n\"What a wonderfully intimate relationship,\" he said, deliberately\\noutrageous. \"And what an intensity of feeling it must generate! I often think\\none may have missed something in not having had a mother. And perhaps you\\'ve\\nmissed something in not being a mother, Lenina. Imagine yourself sitting there\\nwith a little baby of your own. …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Bernard! How can you?\" The passage of an old woman with ophthalmia and a\\ndisease of the skin distracted her from her indignation.\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go away,\" she begged. \"I don\\'t like it.\"\\n\\n\\nBut at this moment their guide came back and, beckoning them to follow,\\nled the way down the narrow street between the houses. They rounded a corner.\\nA dead dog was lying on a rubbish heap; a woman with a goitre was looking for\\nlice in the hair of a small girl. Their guide halted at the foot of a ladder,\\nraised his hand perpendicularly, then darted it horizontally forward. They did\\nwhat he mutely commanded–climbed the ladder and walked through the doorway, to\\nwhich it gave access, into a long narrow room, rather dark and smelling of\\nsmoke and cooked grease and long-worn, long-unwashed clothes. At the further\\nend of the room was another doorway, through which came a shaft of sunlight\\nand the noise, very loud and close, of the drums.\\n\\n\\nThey stepped across the threshold and found themselves on a wide terrace.\\nBelow them, shut in by the tall houses, was the village square, crowded with\\nIndians. Bright blankets, and feathers in black hair, and the glint of\\nturquoise, and dark skins shining with heat. Lenina put her handkerchief to\\nher nose again. In the open space at the centre of the square were two\\ncircular platforms of masonry and trampled clay–the roofs, it was evident, of\\nunderground chambers; for in the centre of each platform was an open hatchway,\\nwith a ladder emerging from the lower darkness. A sound of subterranean flute\\nplaying came up and was almost lost in the steady remorseless persistence of\\nthe drums.\\n\\n\\nLenina liked the drums. Shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their\\nsoft repeated thunder, allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more\\ncompletely, till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep\\npulse of sound. It reminded her reassuringly of the synthetic noises made at\\nSolidarity Services and Ford\\'s Day celebrations. \"Orgy-porgy,\" she whispered\\nto herself. These drums beat out just the same rhythms.\\n\\n\\nThere was a sudden startling burst of singing–hundreds of male voices\\ncrying out fiercely in harsh metallic unison. A few long notes and silence,\\nthe thunderous silence of the drums; then shrill, in a neighing treble, the\\nwomen\\'s answer. Then again the drums; and once more the men\\'s deep savage\\naffirmation of their manhood.\\n\\n\\nQueer–yes. The place was queer, so was the music, so were the clothes and\\nthe goitres and the skin diseases and the old people. But the performance\\nitself–there seemed to be nothing specially queer about that.\\n\\n\\n\"It reminds me of a lower-caste Community Sing,\" she told Bernard.\\n\\n\\nBut a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocuous\\nfunction. For suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers\\nunderground a ghastly troop of monsters. Hideously masked or painted out of\\nall semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round\\nthe square; round and again round, singing as they went, round and round–each\\ntime a little faster; and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm, so\\nthat it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears; and the crowd had begun\\nto sing with the dancers, louder and louder; and first one woman had shrieked,\\nand then another and another, as though they were being killed; and then\\nsuddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line, ran to a big wooden\\nchest which was standing at one end of the square, raised the lid and pulled\\nout a pair of black snakes. A great yell went up from the crowd, and all the\\nother dancers ran towards him with out-stretched hands. He tossed the snakes\\nto the first-comers, then dipped back into the chest for more. More and more,\\nblack snakes and brown and mottled-he flung them out. And then the dance began\\nagain on a different rhythm. Round and round they went with their snakes,\\nsnakily, with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. Round and\\nround. Then the leader gave a signal, and one after another, all the snakes\\nwere flung down in the middle of the square; an old man came up from\\nunderground and sprinkled them with corn meal, and from the other hatchway\\ncame a woman and sprinkled them with water from a black jar. Then the old man\\nlifted his hand and, startlingly, terrifyingly, there was absolute silence. The\\ndrums stopped beating, life seemed to have come to an end. The old man pointed\\ntowards the two hatchways that gave entrance to the lower world. And slowly,\\nraised by invisible hands from below, there emerged from the one a painted\\nimage of an eagle, from the other that of a man, naked, and nailed to a cross.\\nThey hung there, seemingly self-sustained, as though watching. The old man\\nclapped his hands. Naked but for a white cotton breech-cloth, a boy of about\\neighteen stepped out of the crowd and stood before him, his hands crossed over\\nhis chest, his head bowed. The old man made the sign of the cross over him and\\nturned away. Slowly, the boy began to walk round the writhing heap of snakes.\\nHe had completed the first circuit and was half-way through the second when,\\nfrom among the dancers, a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and holding in\\nhis hand a whip of plaited leather, advanced towards him. The boy moved on as\\nthough unaware of the other\\'s existence. The coyote-man raised his whip, there\\nwas a long moment of expectancy, then a swift movement, the whistle of the\\nlash and its loud flat-sounding impact on the flesh. The boy\\'s body quivered;\\nbut he made no sound, he walked on at the same slow, steady pace. The coyote\\nstruck again, again; and at every blow at first a gasp, and then a deep groan\\nwent up from the crowd. The boy walked. Twice, thrice, four times round he\\nwent. The blood was streaming. Five times round, six times round. Suddenly\\nLenina covered her face shish her hands and began to sob. \"Oh, stop them, stop\\nthem!\" she implored. But the whip fell and fell inexorably. Seven times round.\\nThen all at once the boy staggered and, still without a sound, pitched forward\\non to his face. Bending over him, the old man touched his back with a long\\nwhite feather, held it up for a moment, crimson, for the people to see then\\nshook it thrice over the snakes. A few drops fell, and suddenly the drums\\nbroke out again into a panic of hurrying notes; there was a great shout. The\\ndancers rushed forward, picked up the snakes and ran out of the square. Men,\\nwomen, children, all the crowd ran after them. A minute later the square was\\nempty, only the boy remained, prone where he had fallen, quite still. Three\\nold women came out of one of the houses, and with some difficulty lifted him\\nand carried him in. The eagle and the man on the cross kept guard for a little\\nwhile over the empty pueblo; then, as though they had seen enough, sank slowly\\ndown through their hatchways, out of sight, into the nether world.\\n\\n\\nLenina was still sobbing. \"Too awful,\" she kept repeating, and all\\nBernard\\'s consolations were in vain. \"Too awful! That blood!\" She shuddered.\\n\"Oh, I wish I had my soma.\"\\n\\nThere was the sound of feet in the inner room.\\n\\n\\nLenina did not move, but sat with her face in her hands, unseeing, apart.\\nOnly Bernard turned round.\\n\\n\\nThe dress of the young man who now stepped out on to the terrace was\\nIndian; but his plaited hair was straw-coloured, his eyes a pale blue, and his\\nskin a white skin, bronzed.\\n\\n\\n\"Hullo. Good-morrow,\" said the stranger, in faultless but peculiar\\nEnglish. \"You\\'re civilized, aren\\'t you? You come from the Other Place, outside\\nthe Reservation?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Who on earth … ?\" Bernard began in astonishment.\\n\\n\\nThe young man sighed and shook his head. \"A most unhappy gentleman.\" And,\\npointing to the bloodstains in the centre of the square, \"Do you see that\\ndamned spot?\" he asked in a voice that trembled with emotion.\\n\\n\\n\"A gramme is better than a damn,\" said Lenina mechanically from behind her\\nhands. \"I wish I had my soma!\"\\n\\n\\n\"I ought to have been there,\" the young man went on. \"Why wouldn\\'t\\nthey let me be the sacrifice? I\\'d have gone round ten times–twelve, fifteen.\\nPalowhtiwa only got as far as seven. They could have had twice as much blood\\nfrom me. The multitudinous seas incarnadine.\" He flung out his arms in a\\nlavish gesture; then, despairingly, let them fall again. \"But they wouldn\\'t\\nlet me. They disliked me for my complexion. It\\'s always been like that.\\nAlways.\" Tears stood in the young man\\'s eyes; he was ashamed and turned away.\\n\\n\\nAstonishment made Lenina forget the deprivation of soma. She\\nuncovered her face and, for the first time, looked at the stranger. \"Do you\\nmean to say that you wanted to be hit with that whip?\"\\n\\n\\nStill averted from her, the young man made a sign of affirmation. \"For the\\nsake of the pueblo–to make the rain come and the corn grow. And to please\\nPookong and Jesus. And then to show that I can bear pain without crying out.\\nYes,\" and his voice suddenly took on a new resonance, he turned with a proud\\nsquaring of the shoulders, a proud, defiant lifting of the chin \"to show that\\nI\\'m a man … Oh!\" He gave a gasp and was silent, gaping. He had seen, for the\\nfirst time in his life, the face of a girl whose cheeks were not the colour of\\nchocolate or dogskin, whose hair was auburn and permanently waved, and whose\\nexpression (amazing novelty!) was one of benevolent interest. Lenina was\\nsmiling at him; such a nice-looking boy, she was thinking, and a really\\nbeautiful body. The blood rushed up into the young man\\'s face; he dropped his\\neyes, raised them again for a moment only to find her still smiling at him,\\nand was so much overcome that he had to turn away and pretend to be looking\\nvery hard at something on the other side of the square.\\n\\n\\nBernard\\'s questions made a diversion. Who? How? When? From where? Keeping\\nhis eyes fixed on Bernard\\'s face (for so passionately did he long to see\\nLenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her), the young man tried to\\nexplain himself. Linda and he–Linda was his mother (the word made Lenina look\\nuncomfortable)–were strangers in the Reservation. Linda had come from the\\nOther Place long ago, before he was born, with a man who was his father.\\n(Bernard pricked up his ears.) She had gone walking alone in those mountains\\nover there to the North, had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. (\"Go\\non, go on,\" said Bernard excitedly.) Some hunters from Malpais had found her\\nand brought her to the pueblo. As for the man who was his father, Linda had\\nnever seen him again. His name was Tomakin. (Yes, \"Thomas\" was the D.H.C.\\'s\\nfirst name.) He must have flown away, back to the Other Place, away without\\nher–a bad, unkind, unnatural man.\\n\\n\\n\"And so I was born in Malpais,\" he concluded. \"In Malpais.\" And he shook\\nhis head.\\n\\n\\nThe squalor of that little house on the outskirts of the pueblo!\\n\\n\\nA space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. Two\\nfamine-stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. Inside,\\nwhen they entered, the twilight stank and was loud with flies.\\n\\n\\n\"Linda!\" the young man called.\\n\\n\\nFrom the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said, \"Coming.\"\\n\\n\\nThey waited. In bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal, perhaps of\\nseveral meals.\\n\\n\\nThe door opened. A very stout blonde squaw stepped across the threshold\\nand stood looking at the strangers staring incredulously, her mouth open.\\nLenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth were missing. And the\\ncolour of the ones that remained … She shuddered. It was worse than the old\\nman. So fat. And all the lines in her face, the flabbiness, the wrinkles. And\\nthe sagging cheeks, with those purplish blotches. And the red veins on her\\nnose, the bloodshot eyes. And that neck–that neck; and the blanket she wore\\nover her head–ragged and filthy. And under the brown sack-shaped tunic those\\nenormous breasts, the bulge of the stomach, the hips. Oh, much worse than the\\nold man, much worse! And suddenly the creature burst out in a torrent of\\nspeech, rushed at her with outstretched arms and–Ford! Ford! it was too\\nrevolting, in another moment she\\'d be sick–pressed her against the bulge, the\\nbosom, and began to kiss her. Ford! to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt\\ntoo horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly\\nstuff that was put into Delta and Epsilon bottles (no, it wasn\\'t true about\\nBernard), positively stank of alcohol. She broke away as quickly as she could.\\n\\n\\nA blubbered and distorted face confronted her; the creature was crying.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear.\" The torrent of words flowed sobbingly. \"If you\\nknew how glad–after all these years! A civilized face. Yes, and civilized\\nclothes. Because I thought I should never see a piece of real acetate silk\\nagain.\" She fingered the sleeve of Lenina\\'s shirt. The nails were black. \"And\\nthose adorable viscose velveteen shorts! Do you know, dear, I\\'ve still got my\\nold clothes, the ones I came in, put away in a box. I\\'ll show them you\\nafterwards. Though, of course, the acetate has all gone into holes. But such a\\nlovely white bandolier–though I must say your green morocco is even lovelier.\\nNot that it did me much good, that bandolier.\" Her tears began to flow\\nagain. \"I suppose John told you. What I had to suffer–and not a gramme of\\nsoma to be had. Only a drink of mescal every now and then, when\\nPopé used to bring it. Popé is a boy I used to know. But it makes you feel so\\nbad afterwards. the mescal does, and you\\'re sick with the\\npeyotl; besides it always made that awful feeling of being ashamed much\\nworse the next day. And I was so ashamed. Just think of it: me, a Beta–having\\na baby: put yourself in my place.\" (The mere suggestion made Lenina shudder.)\\n\"Though it wasn\\'t my fault, I swear; because I still don\\'t know how it\\nhappened, seeing that I did all the Malthusian Drill–you know, by numbers,\\nOne, two, three, four, always, I swear it; but all the same it happened, and\\nof course there wasn\\'t anything like an Abortion Centre here. Is it still down\\nin Chelsea, by the way?\" she asked. Lenina nodded. \"And still floodlighted on\\nTuesdays and Fridays?\" Lenina nodded again. \"That lovely pink glass tower!\"\\nPoor Linda lifted her face and with closed eyes ecstatically contemplated the\\nbright remembered image. \"And the river at night,\" she whispered. Great tears\\noozed slowly out from behind her tight-shut eyelids. \"And flying back in the\\nevening from Stoke Poges. And then a hot bath and vibro-vacuum massage … But\\nthere.\" She drew a deep breath, shook her head, opened her eyes again, sniffed\\nonce or twice, then blew her nose on her fingers and wiped them on the skirt\\nof her tunic. \"Oh, I\\'m so sorry,\" she said in response to Lenina\\'s involuntary\\ngrimace of disgust. \"I oughtn\\'t to have done that. I\\'m sorry. But what are you\\nto do when there aren\\'t any handkerchiefs? I remember how it used to upset me,\\nall that dirt, and nothing being aseptic. I had an awful cut on my head when\\nthey first brought me here. You can\\'t imagine what they used to put on it.\\nFilth, just filth. \\'Civilization is Sterilization,\\' I used to say t them. And\\n\\'Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T, to see a fine bathroom and W.C.\\' as though they\\nwere children. But of course they didn\\'t understand. How should they? And in\\nthe end I suppose I got used to it. And anyhow, how can you keep things\\nclean when there isn\\'t hot water laid on? And look at these clothes. This\\nbeastly wool isn\\'t like acetate. It lasts and lasts. And you\\'re supposed to\\nmend it if it gets torn. But I\\'m a Beta; I worked in the Fertilizing Room;\\nnobody ever taught me to do anything like that. It wasn\\'t my business.\\nBesides, it never used to be right to mend clothes. Throw them away when\\nthey\\'ve got holes in them and buy new. \\'The more stitches, the less riches.\\'\\nIsn\\'t that right? Mending\\'s anti-social. But it\\'s all different here. It\\'s\\nlike living with lunatics. Everything they do is mad.\" She looked round; saw\\nJohn and Bernard had left them and were walking up and down in the dust and\\ngarbage outside the house; but, none the less confidentially lowering her\\nvoice, and leaning, while Lenina stiffened and shrank, so close that the blown\\nreek of embryo-poison stirred the hair on her cheek. \"For instance,\" she\\nhoarsely whispered, \"take the way they have one another here. Mad, I tell you,\\nabsolutely mad. Everybody belongs to every one else–don\\'t they? don\\'t they?\"\\nshe insisted, tugging at Lenina\\'s sleeve. Lenina nodded her averted head, let\\nout the breath she had been holding and managed to draw another one,\\nrelatively untainted. \"Well, here,\" the other went on, \"nobody\\'s supposed to\\nbelong to more than one person. And if you have people in the ordinary way,\\nthe others think you\\'re wicked and anti-social. They hate and despise you.\\nOnce a lot of women came and made a scene because their men came to see me.\\nWell, why not? And then they rushed at me … No, it was too awful. I can\\'t tell\\nyou about it.\" Linda covered her face with her hands and shuddered. \"They\\'re\\nso hateful, the women here. Mad, mad and cruel. And of course they don\\'t know\\nanything about Malthusian Drill, or bottles, or decanting, or anything of that\\nsort. So they\\'re having children all the time–like dogs. It\\'s too revolting.\\nAnd to think that I … Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford! And yet John was a great\\ncomfort to me. I don\\'t know what I should have done without him. Even though\\nhe did get so upset whenever a man … Quite as a tiny boy, even. Once (but that\\nwas when he was bigger) he tried to kill poor Waihusiwa–or was it Popé?–just\\nbecause I used to have them sometimes. Because I never could make him\\nunderstand that that was what civilized people ought to do. Being mad\\'s\\ninfectious I believe. Anyhow, John seems to have caught it from the Indians.\\nBecause, of course, he was with them a lot. Even though they always were so\\nbeastly to him and wouldn\\'t let him do all the things the other boys did.\\nWhich was a good thing in a way, because it made it easier for me to condition\\nhim a little.

As\\nthough we were living on different planets, in different centuries. A mother,\\nand all this dirt, and gods, and old age, and disease …\" He shook his head.\\n\"It\\'s almost inconceivable. I shall never understand, unless you explain.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Explain what?\"\\n\\n\\n\"This.\" He indicated the pueblo. \"That.\" And it was the little house\\noutside the village. \"Everything. All your life.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But what is there to say?\"\\n\\n\\n\"From the beginning. As far back as you can remember.\"\\n\\n\\n\"As far back as I can remember.\" John frowned. There was a long silence.\\n\\n\\nIt was very hot. They had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. Linda\\nsaid, \"Come and lie down, Baby.\" They lay down together in the big bed.\\n\"Sing,\" and Linda sang. Sang \"Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T\" and \"Bye Baby\\nBanting, soon you\\'ll need decanting.\" Her voice got fainter and fainter …\\n\\n\\nThere was a loud noise, and he woke with a start. A man was saying\\nsomething to Linda, and Linda was laughing. She had pulled the blanket up to\\nher chin, but the man pulled it down again. His hair was like two black ropes,\\nand round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with blue stones in it. He\\nliked the bracelet; but all the same, he was frightened; he hid his face\\nagainst Linda\\'s body. Linda put her hand on him and he felt safer. In those\\nother words he did not understand so well, she said to the man, \"Not with John\\nhere.\" The man looked at him, then again at Linda, and said a few words in a\\nsoft voice. Linda said, \"No.\" But the man bent over the bed towards him and\\nhis face was huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket.\\n\"No,\" Linda said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. \"No,\\nno!\" But the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. He screamed. The\\nman put up his other hand and lifted him up. Linda was still holding him,\\nstill saying, \"No, no.\" The man said something short and angry, and suddenly\\nher hands were gone. \"Linda, Linda.\" He kicked and wriggled; but the man\\ncarried him across to the door, opened it, put him down on the floor in the\\nmiddle of the other room, and went away, shutting the door behind him. He got\\nup, he ran to the door. Standing on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden\\nlatch. He lifted it and pushed; but the door wouldn\\'t open. \"Linda,\" he\\nshouted. She didn\\'t answer.\\n\\n\\nHe remembered a huge room, rather dark; and there were big wooden things\\nwith strings fastened to them, and lots of women standing round them–making\\nblankets, Linda said. Linda told him to sit in the corner with the other\\nchildren, while she went and helped the women. He played with the little boys\\nfor a long time. Suddenly people started talking very loud, and there were the\\nwomen pushing Linda away, and Linda was crying. She went to the door and he\\nran after her. He asked her why they were angry. \"Because I broke something,\"\\nshe said. And then she got angry too. \"How should I know how to do their\\nbeastly weaving?\" she said. \"Beastly savages.\" He asked her what savages were.\\nWhen they got back to their house, Popé was waiting at the door, and he came\\nin with them. He had a big gourd full of stuff that looked like water; only it\\nwasn\\'t water, but something with a bad smell that burnt your mouth and made\\nyou cough. Linda drank some and Popé drank some, and then Linda laughed a lot\\nand talked very loud; and then she and Popé went into the other room. When\\nPopé went away, he went into the room. Linda was in bed and so fast asleep\\nthat he couldn\\'t wake her.\\n\\n\\nPopé used to come often. He said the stuff in the gourd was called\\nmescal; but Linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made\\nyou feel ill afterwards. He hated Popé. He hated them all–all the men who came\\nto see Linda. One afternoon, when he had been playing with the other\\nchildren–it was cold, he remembered, and there was snow on the mountains–he\\ncame back to the house and heard angry voices in the bedroom. They were\\nwomen\\'s voices, and they said words he didn\\'t understand, but he knew they\\nwere dreadful words. Then suddenly, crash! something was upset; he heard\\npeople moving about quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like\\nhitting a mule, only not so bony; then Linda screamed. \"Oh, don\\'t, don\\'t,\\ndon\\'t!\" she said. He ran in. There were three women in dark blankets. Linda\\nwas on the bed. One of the women was holding her wrists. Another was lying\\nacross her legs, so that she couldn\\'t kick. The third was hitting her with a\\nwhip. Once, twice, three times; and each time Linda screamed. Crying, he\\ntugged at the fringe of the woman\\'s blanket. \"Please, please.\" With her free\\nhand she held him away. The whip came down again, and again Linda screamed. He\\ncaught hold of the woman\\'s enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with\\nall his might. She cried out, wrenched her hand free, and gave him such a push\\nthat he fell down. While he was lying on the ground she hit him three times\\nwith the whip. It hurt more than anything he had ever felt–like fire. The whip\\nwhistled again, fell. But this time it was Linda who screamed.\\n\\n\\n\"But why did they want to hurt you, Linda?\\'\\' he asked that night. He was\\ncrying, because the red marks of the whip on his back still hurt so terribly.\\nBut he was also crying because people were so beastly and unfair, and because\\nhe was only a little boy and couldn\\'t do anything against them. Linda was\\ncrying too. She was grown up, but she wasn\\'t big enough to fight against three\\nof them. It wasn\\'t fair for her either. \"Why did they want to hurt you,\\nLinda?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. How should I know?\" It was difficult to hear what she said,\\nbecause she was lying on her stomach and her face was in the pillow. \"They say\\nthose men are their men,\" she went on; and she did not seem to be\\ntalking to him at all; she seemed to be talking with some one inside herself.\\nA long talk which she didn\\'t understand; and in the end she started crying\\nlouder than ever.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t cry, Linda. Don\\'t cry.\"\\n\\n\\nHe pressed himself against her. He put his arm round her neck. Linda cried\\nout. \"Oh, be careful. My shoulder! Oh!\" and she pushed him away, hard. His\\nhead banged against the wall. \"Little idiot!\" she shouted; and then, suddenly,\\nshe began to slap him. Slap, slap …\\n\\n\\n\"Linda,\" he cried out. \"Oh, mother, don\\'t!\"\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not your mother. I won\\'t be your mother.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, Linda … Oh!\" She slapped him on the cheek.\\n\\n\\n\"Turned into a savage,\" she shouted. \"Having young ones like an animal …\\nIf it hadn\\'t been for you, I might have gone to the Inspector, I might have\\ngot away. But not with a baby. That would have been too shameful.\"\\n\\n\\nHe saw that she was going to hit him again, and lifted his arm to guard\\nhis face. \"Oh, don\\'t, Linda, please don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Little beast!\" She pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered.\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, Linda.\" He shut his eyes, expecting the blow.\\n\\n\\nBut she didn\\'t hit him. After a little time, he opened his eyes again and\\nsaw that she was looking at him. He tried to smile at her. Suddenly she put\\nher arms round him and kissed him again and again.\\n\\n\\nSometimes, for several days, Linda didn\\'t get up at all. She lay in bed\\nand was sad. Or else she drank the stuff that Popé brought and laughed a great\\ndeal and went to sleep. Sometimes she was sick. Often she forgot to wash him,\\nand there was nothing to eat except cold tortillas. He remembered the first\\ntime she found those little animals in his hair, how she screamed and\\nscreamed.\\n\\n\\nThe happiest times were when she told him about the Other Place. \"And you\\nreally can go flying, whenever you like?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Whenever you like.\" And she would tell him about the lovely music that\\ncame out of a box, and all the nice games you could play, and the delicious\\nthings to eat and drink, and the light that came when you pressed a little\\nthing in the wall, and the pictures that you could hear and feel and smell, as\\nwell as see, and another box for making nice smells, and the pink and green\\nand blue and silver houses as high as mountains, and everybody happy and no\\none ever sad or angry, and every one belonging to every one else, and the\\nboxes where you could see and hear what was happening at the other side of the\\nworld, and babies in lovely clean bottles–everything so clean, and no nasty\\nsmells, no dirt at all–and people never lonely, but living together and being\\nso jolly and happy, like the summer dances here in Malpais, but much happier,\\nand the happiness being there every day, every day. … He listened by the hour.\\nAnd sometimes, when he and the other children were tired with too much\\nplaying, one of the old men of the pueblo would talk to them, in those other\\nwords, of the great Transformer of the World, and of the long fight between\\nRight Hand and Left Hand, between Wet and Dry; of Awonawilona, who made a\\ngreat fog by thinking in the night, and then made the whole world out of the\\nfog; of Earth Mother and Sky Father; of Ahaiyuta and Marsailema, the twins of\\nWar and Chance; of Jesus and Pookong; of Mary and Etsanatlehi, the woman who\\nmakes herself young again; of the Black Stone at Laguna and the Great Eagle\\nand Our Lady of Acoma. Strange stories, all the more wonderful to him for\\nbeing told in the other words and so not fully understood. Lying in bed, he\\nwould think of Heaven and London and Our Lady of Acoma and the rows and rows\\nof babies in clean bottles and Jesus flying up and Linda flying up and the\\ngreat Director of World Hatcheries and Awonawilona.\\n\\n\\nLots of men came to see Linda. The boys began to point their fingers at\\nhim. In the strange other words they said that Linda was bad; they called her\\nnames he did not understand, but that he knew were bad names. One day they\\nsang a song about her, again and again. He threw stones at them. They threw\\nback; a sharp stone cut his cheek. The blood wouldn\\'t stop; he was covered with\\nblood.\\n\\n\\nLinda taught him to read. With a piece of charcoal she drew pictures on\\nthe wall–an animal sitting down, a baby inside a bottle; then she wrote\\nletters. THE CAT IS ON THE MAT. THE TOT IS IN THE POT. He learned quickly and\\neasily. When he knew how to read all the words she wrote on the wall, Linda\\nopened her big wooden box and pulled out from under those funny little red\\ntrousers she never wore a thin little book. He had often seen it before. \"When\\nyou\\'re bigger,\" she had said, \"you can read it.\" Well, now he was big enough.\\nHe was proud. \"I\\'m afraid you won\\'t find it very exciting,\" she said. \"But\\nit\\'s the only thing I have.\" She sighed. \"If only you could see the lovely\\nreading machines we used to have in London!\" He began reading. The Chemical\\nand Bacteriological Conditioning of the Embryo. Practical Instructions\\nfor Beta Embryo-Store Workers. It took him a quarter of an hour to read\\nthe title alone. He threw the book on the floor. \"Beastly, beastly book!\" he\\nsaid, and began to cry.\\n\\n\\nThe boys still sang their horrible song about Linda. Sometimes, too, they\\nlaughed at him for being so ragged. When he tore his clothes, Linda did not\\nknow how to mend them. In the Other Place, she told him, people threw away\\nclothes with holes in them and got new ones. \"Rags, rags!\" the boys used to\\nshout at him. \"But I can read,\" he said to himself, \"and they can\\'t. They\\ndon\\'t even know what reading is.\" It was fairly easy, if he thought hard\\nenough about the reading, to pretend that he didn\\'t mind when they made fun of\\nhim. He asked Linda to give him the book again.\\n\\n\\nThe more the boys pointed and sang, the harder he read. Soon he could read\\nall the words quite well. Even the longest. But what did they mean? He asked\\nLinda; but even when she could answer it didn\\'t seem to make it very clear,\\nAnd generally she couldn\\'t answer at all.\\n\\n\\n\"What are chemicals?\" he would ask.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, stuff like magnesium salts, and alcohol for keeping the Deltas and\\nEpsilons small and backward, and calcium carbonate for bones, and all that\\nsort of thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But how do you make chemicals, Linda? Where do they come from?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know. You get them out of bottles. And when the bottles are\\nempty, you send up to the Chemical Store for more. It\\'s the Chemical Store\\npeople who make them, I suppose. Or else they send to the factory for them. I\\ndon\\'t know. I never did any chemistry. My job was always with the embryos. It\\nwas the same with everything else he asked about. Linda never seemed to know.\\nThe old men of the pueblo had much more definite answers.\\n\\n\\n\"The seed of men and all creatures, the seed of the sun and the seed of\\nearth and the seed of the sky–Awonawilona made them all out of the Fog of\\nIncrease. Now the world has four wombs; and he laid the seeds in the lowest of\\nthe four wombs. And gradually the seeds began to grow …\"\\n\\n\\nOne day (John calculated later that it must have been soon after his\\ntwelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never seen before\\nlying on the floor in the bedroom. It was a thick book and looked very old.\\nThe binding had been eaten by mice; some of its pages were loose and crumpled.\\nHe picked it up, looked at the title-page: the book was called The Complete\\nWorks of William Shakespeare.\\n\\n\\nLinda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal\\nout of a cup. \"Popé brought it,\" she said. Her voice was thick and hoarse like\\nsomebody else\\'s voice. \"It was lying in one of the chests of the Antelope\\nKiva. It\\'s supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. I expect it\\'s\\ntrue, because I looked at it, and it seemed to be full of nonsense.\\nUncivilized. Still, it\\'ll be good enough for you to practice your reading on.\"\\nShe took a last sip, set the cup down on the floor beside the bed, turned over\\non her side, hiccoughed once or twice and went to sleep.\\n\\n\\nHe opened the book at random.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNay, but to live\\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\\nStew\\'d in corruption, honeying and making love\\nOver the nasty sty …\\n\\n\\nThe strange words rolled through his mind; rumbled, like talking thunder;\\nlike the drums at the summer dances, if the drums could have spoken; like the\\nmen singing the Corn Song, beautiful, beautiful, so that you cried; like old\\nMitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of\\nbone and stone–kiathla tsilu silokwe silokwe silokwe. Kiai silu silu,\\ntsithl–but better than Mitsima\\'s magic, because it meant more, because it\\ntalked to him, talked wonderfully and only half-understandably, a terrible\\nbeautiful magic, about Linda; about Linda lying there snoring, with the empty\\ncup on the floor beside the bed; about Linda and Popé, Linda and Popé.\\n\\n\\nHe hated Popé more and more. A man can smile and smile and be a villain.\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. What did the words\\nexactly mean? He only half knew. But their magic was strong and went on\\nrumbling in his head, and somehow it was as though he had never really hated\\nPopé before; never really hated him because he had never been able to say how\\nmuch he hated him. But now he had these words, these words like drums and\\nsinging and magic. These words and the strange, strange story out of which\\nthey were taken (he couldn\\'t make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful,\\nwonderful all the same)–they gave him a reason for hating Popé; and they made\\nhis hatred more real; they even made Popé himself more real.\\n\\n\\nOne day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room was\\nopen, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep–white Linda and Popé\\nalmost black beside her, with one arm under her shoulders and the other dark\\nhand on her breast, and one of the plaits of his long hair lying across her\\nthroat, like a black snake trying to strangle her. Popé\\'s gourd and a cup were\\nstanding on the floor near the bed. Linda was snoring.\\n\\n\\nHis heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. He was empty. Empty,\\nand cold, and rather sick, and giddy. He leaned against the wall to steady\\nhimself. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous … Like drums, like the men\\nsinging for the corn, like magic, the words repeated and repeated themselves\\nin his head. From being cold he was suddenly hot. His cheeks burnt with the\\nrush of blood, the room swam and darkened before his eyes. He ground his\\nteeth. \"I\\'ll kill him, I\\'ll kill him, I\\'ll kill him,\" he kept saying. And\\nsuddenly there were more words.\\n\\n\\nWhen he is drunk asleep, or in his rage\\nOr in the incestuous pleasure of his bed …\\n\\nThe magic was on his side, the magic explained and gave orders. He stepped\\nback in the outer room. \"When he is drunk asleep …\" The knife for the meat was\\nlying on the floor near the fireplace. He picked it up and tiptoed to the door\\nagain. \"When he is drunk asleep, drunk asleep …\" He ran across the room and\\nstabbed–oh, the blood!–stabbed again, as Popé heaved out of his sleep, lifted\\nhis hand to stab once more, but found his wrist caught, held and–oh,\\noh!–twisted. He couldn\\'t move, he was trapped, and there were Popé\\'s small\\nblack eyes, very close, staring into his own. He looked away. There were two\\ncuts on Popé\\'s left shoulder. \"Oh, look at the blood!\" Linda was crying. \"Look\\nat the blood!\" She had never been able to bear the sight of blood. Popé lifted\\nhis other hand–to strike him, he thought. He stiffened to receive the blow.\\nBut the hand only took him under the chin and turned his face, so that he had\\nto look again into Popé\\'s eyes. For a long time, for hours and hours. And\\nsuddenly–he couldn\\'t help it–he began to cry. Popé burst out laughing. \"Go,\"\\nhe said, in the other Indian words. \"Go, my brave Ahaiyuta.\" He ran out into\\nthe other room to hide his tears.\\n\\n\"You are fifteen,\" said old Mitsima, in the Indian words. \"Now I may teach\\nyou to work the clay.\"\\n\\n\\nSquatting by the river, they worked together.\\n\\n\\n\"First of all,\" said Mitsima, taking a lump of the wetted clay between his\\nhands, \"we make a little moon.\" The old man squeezed the lump into a disk,\\nthen bent up the edges, the moon became a shallow cup.\\n\\n\\nSlowly and unskilfully he imitated the old man\\'s delicate gestures.\\n\\n\\n\"A moon, a cup, and now a snake.\" Mitsima rolled out another piece of clay\\ninto a long flexible cylinder, trooped it into a circle and pressed it on to\\nthe rim of the cup. \"Then another snake. And another. And another.\" Round by\\nround, Mitsima built up the sides of the pot; it was narrow, it bulged, it\\nnarrowed again towards the neck. Mitsima squeezed and patted, stroked and\\nscraped; and there at last it stood, in shape the familiar water pot of\\nMalpais, but creamy white instead of black, and still soft to the touch. The\\ncrooked parody of Mitsima\\'s, his own stood beside it. Looking at the two pots,\\nhe had to laugh.\\n\\n\\n\"But the next one will be better,\" he said, and began to moisten another\\npiece of clay.\\n\\n\\nTo fashion, to give form, to feel his fingers gaining in skill and\\npower–this gave him an extraordinary pleasure. \"A, B, C, Vitamin D,\" he sang\\nto himself as he worked. \"The fat\\'s in the liver, the cod\\'s in the sea.\" And\\nMitsima also sang–a song about killing a bear. They worked all day, and all\\nday he was filled with an intense, absorbing happiness.\\n\\n\\n\"Next winter,\" said old Mitsima, \"I will teach you to make the bow.\"\\n\\n\\nHe stood for a long time outside the house, and at last the ceremonies\\nwithin were finished. The door opened; they came out. Kothlu came first, his\\nright hand out-stretched and tightly closed, as though over some precious\\njewel. Her clenched hand similarly outstretched, Kiakimé followed. They walked\\nin silence, and in silence, behind them, came the brothers and sisters and\\ncousins and all the troop of old people.\\n\\n\\nThey walked out of the pueblo, across the mesa. At the edge of the cliff\\nthey halted, facing the early morning sun. Kothlu opened his hand. A pinch of\\ncorn meal lay white on the palm; he breathed on it, murmured a few words, then\\nthrew it, a handful of white dust, towards the sun. Kiakimé did the same. Then\\nKhakimé\\'s father stepped forward, and holding up a feathered prayer stick,\\nmade a long prayer, then threw the stick after the corn meal.\\n\\n\\n\"It is finished,\" said old Mitsima in a loud voice. \"They are married.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Linda, as they turned away, \"all I can say is, it does seem a\\nlot of fuss to make about so little. In civilized countries, when a boy wants\\nto have a girl, he just … But where are you going, John?\"\\n\\n\\nHe paid no attention to her calling, but ran on, away, away, anywhere to\\nbe by himself.\\n\\n\\nIt is finished Old Mitsima\\'s words repeated themselves in his mind.\\nFinished, finished … In silence and from a long way off, but violently,\\ndesperately, hopelessly, he had loved Kiakimé. And now it was finished. He was\\nsixteen.\\n\\n\\nAt the full moon, in the Antelope Kiva, secrets would be told, secrets\\nwould be done and borne. They would go down, boys, into the kiva and come out\\nagain, men. The boys were all afraid and at the same time impatient. And at\\nlast it was the day. The sun went down, the moon rose. He went with the\\nothers. Men were standing, dark, at the entrance to the kiva; the ladder went\\ndown into the red lighted depths. Already the leading boys had begun to climb\\ndown. Suddenly, one of the men stepped forward, caught him by the arm, and\\npulled him out of the ranks. He broke free and dodged back into his place\\namong the others. This time the man struck him, pulled his hair. \"Not for you,\\nwhite-hair!\" \"Not for the son of the she-dog,\" said one of the other men. The\\nboys laughed. \"Go!\" And as he still hovered on the fringes of the group, \"Go!\"\\nthe men shouted again. One of them bent down, took a stone, threw it. \"Go, go,\\ngo!\" There was a shower of stones. Bleeding, he ran away into the darkness.\\nFrom the red-lit kiva came the noise of singing. The last of the boys had\\nclimbed down the ladder. He was all alone.\\n\\n\\nAll alone, outside the pueblo, on the bare plain of the mesa. The rock was\\nlike bleached bones in the moonlight. Down in the valley, the coyotes were\\nhowling at the moon. The bruises hurt him, the cuts were still bleeding; but\\nit was not for pain that he sobbed; it was because he was all alone, because\\nhe had been driven out, alone, into this skeleton world of rocks and\\nmoonlight. At the edge of the precipice he sat down. The moon was behind him;\\nhe looked down into the black shadow of the mesa, into the black shadow of\\ndeath. He had only to take one step, one little jump. … He held out his right\\nhand in the moonlight. From the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing.\\nEvery few seconds a drop fell, dark, almost colourless in the dead light.\\nDrop, drop, drop. To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow …\\n\\n\\nHe had discovered Time and Death and God.\\n\\n\\n\"Alone, always alone,\" the young man was saying.\\n\\n\\nThe words awoke a plaintive echo in Bernard\\'s mind. Alone, alone … \"So am\\nI,\" he said, on a gush of confidingness. \"Terribly alone.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Are you?\" John looked surprised. \"I thought that in the Other Place … I\\nmean, Linda always said that nobody was ever alone there.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard blushed uncomfortably. \"You see,\" he said, mumbling and with\\naverted eyes, \"I\\'m rather different from most people, I suppose. If one\\nhappens to be decanted different …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s just it.\" The young man nodded. \"If one\\'s different, one\\'s\\nbound to be lonely. They\\'re beastly to one. Do you know, they shut me out of\\nabsolutely everything? When the other boys were sent out to spend the night on\\nthe mountains–you know, when you have to dream which your sacred animal\\nis–they wouldn\\'t let me go with the others; they wouldn\\'t tell me any of the\\nsecrets. I did it by myself, though,\" he added. \"Didn\\'t eat anything for five\\ndays and then went out one night alone into those mountains there.\" He\\npointed.\\n\\n\\nPatronizingly, Bernard smiled. \"And did you dream of anything?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\nThe other nodded. \"But I mustn\\'t tell you what.\" He was silent for a\\nlittle; then, in a low voice, \"Once,\" he went on, \"I did something that none\\nof the others did: I stood against a rock in the middle of the day, in summer,\\nwith my arms out, like Jesus on the Cross.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What on earth for?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I wanted to know what it was like being crucified. Hanging there in the\\nsun …\"\\n\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why? Well …\" He hesitated. \"Because I felt I ought to. If Jesus could\\nstand it. And then, if one has done something wrong … Besides, I was unhappy;\\nthat was another reason.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It seems a funny way of curing your unhappiness,\" said Bernard. But on\\nsecond thoughts he decided that there was, after all, some sense in it. Better\\nthan taking soma …\\n\\n\\n\"I fainted after a time,\" said the young man. \"Fell down on my face. Do\\nyou see the mark where I cut myself?\" He lifted the thick yellow hair from his\\nforehead. The scar showed, pale and puckered, on his right temple.\\n\\n\\nBernard looked, and then quickly, with a little shudder, averted his eyes.\\nHis conditioning had made him not so much pitiful as profoundly squeamish. The\\nmere suggestion of illness or wounds was to him not only horrifying, but even\\nrepulsive and rather disgusting. Like dirt, or deformity, or old age. Hastily\\nhe changed the subject.\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder if you\\'d like to come back to London with us?\" he asked, making\\nthe first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been secretly elaborating\\never since, in the little house, he had realized who the \"father\" of this young\\nsavage must be. \"Would you like that?\"\\n\\n\\nThe young man\\'s face lit up. \"Do you really mean it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course; if I can get permission, that is.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Linda too?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well …\" He hesitated doubtfully. That revolting creature! No, it was\\nimpossible. Unless, unless … It suddenly occurred to Bernard that her very\\nrevoltingness might prove an enormous asset. \"But of course!\" he cried, making\\nup for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cordiality.\\n\\n\\nThe young man drew a deep breath. \"To think it should be coming true–what\\nI\\'ve dreamt of all my life. Do you remember what Miranda says?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Who\\'s Miranda?\"\\n\\n\\nBut the young man had evidently not heard the question. \"O wonder!\" he was\\nsaying; and his eyes shone, his face was brightly flushed. \"How many goodly\\ncreatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!\" The flush suddenly\\ndeepened; he was thinking of Lenina, of an angel in bottle-green viscose,\\nlustrous with youth and skin food, plump, benevolently smiling. His voice\\nfaltered. \"O brave new world,\" he began, then-suddenly interrupted himself;\\nthe blood had left his cheeks; he was as pale as paper.\\n\\n\\n\"Are you married to her?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\"Am I what?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Married.

As soon as they got\\nback to the rest-house, she swallowed six half-gramme tablets of soma,\\nlay down on her bed, and within ten minutes had embarked for lunar eternity.\\nIt would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again.\\n\\nBernard meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. It was long after\\nmidnight before he fell asleep. Long after midnight; but his insomnia had not\\nbeen fruitless; he had a plan.\\n\\n\\nPunctually, on the following morning, at ten o\\'clock, the green-uniformed\\noctoroon stepped out of his helicopter. Bernard was waiting for him among the\\nagaves.\\n\\n\\n\"Miss Crowne\\'s gone on soma-holiday,\" he explained. \"Can hardly be\\nback before five. Which leaves us seven hours.\"\\n\\n\\nHe could fly to Santa Fé, do all the business he had to do, and be in\\nMalpais again long before she woke up.\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'ll be quite safe here by herself?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Safe as helicopters,\" the octoroon assured him.\\n\\n\\nThey climbed into the machine and started off at once. At ten thirty-four\\nthey landed on the roof of the Santa Fé Post Office; at ten thirty-seven\\nBernard had got through to the World Controller\\'s Office in Whitehall; at ten\\nthirty-seven he was speaking to his fordship\\'s fourth personal secretary; at\\nten forty-four he was repeating his story to the first secretary, and at ten\\nforty-seven and a half it was the deep, resonant voice of Mustapha Mond\\nhimself that sounded in his ears.\\n\\n\\n\"I ventured to think,\" stammered Bernard, \"that your fordship might find\\nthe matter of sufficient scientific interest …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I do find it of sufficient scientific interest,\" said the deep\\nvoice. \"Bring these two individuals back to London with you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Your fordship is aware that I shall need a special permit …\"\\n\\n\"The necessary orders,\" said Mustapha Mond, \"are being sent to the Warden\\nof the Reservation at this moment. You will proceed at once to the Warden\\'s\\nOffice. Good-morning, Mr. Marx.\"\\n\\n\\nThere was silence. Bernard hung up the receiver and hurried up to the\\nroof.\\n\\n\\n\"Warden\\'s Office,\" he said to the Gamma-green octoroon.\\n\\n\\nAt ten fifty-four Bernard was shaking hands with the Warden.\\n\\n\\n\"Delighted, Mr. Marx, delighted.\" His boom was deferential. \"We have just\\nreceived special orders …\"\\n\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Bernard, interrupting him. \"I was talking to his fordship\\non the phone a moment ago.\" His bored tone implied that he was in the habit of\\ntalking to his fordship every day of the week. He dropped into a chair. \"If\\nyou\\'ll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as possible. As soon as\\npossible,\" he emphatically repeated. He was thoroughly enjoying himself.\\n\\n\\nAt eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket.\\n\\n\\n\"So long,\" he said patronizingly to the Warden, who had accompanied him as\\nfar as the lift gates. \"So long.\"\\n\\n\\nHe walked across to the hotel, had a bath, a vibro-vac massage, and an\\nelectrolytic shave, listened in to the morning\\'s news, looked in for half an\\nhour on the televisor, ate a leisured luncheon, and at half-past two flew back\\nwith the octoroon to Malpais.\\n\\n\\nThe young man stood outside the rest-house.\\n\\n\\n\"Bernard,\" he called. \"Bernard!\" There was no answer.\\n\\n\\nNoiseless on his deerksin moccasins, he ran up the steps and tried the\\ndoor. The door was locked.\\n\\n\\nThey were gone! Gone! It was the most terrible thing that had ever\\nhappened to him. She had asked him to come and see them, and now they were\\ngone. He sat down on the steps and cried.\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. The\\nfirst thing he saw was a green suit-case, with the initials L.C. painted on\\nthe lid. Joy flared up like fire within him. He picked up a stone. The smashed\\nglass tinkled on the floor. A moment later he was inside the room. He opened\\nthe green suit-case; and all at once he was breathing Lenina\\'s perfume,\\nfilling his lungs with her essential being. His heart beat wildly; for a\\nmoment he was almost faint. Then, bending over the precious box, he touched,\\nhe lifted into the light, he examined. The zippers on Lenina\\'s spare pair of\\nviscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle, then solved, a delight. Zip,\\nand then zip; zip, and then zip; he was enchanted. Her green slippers were the\\nmost beautiful things he had ever seen. He unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks,\\nblushed, put them hastily away again; but kissed a perfumed acetate\\nhandkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. Opening a box, he spilt a cloud\\nof scented powder. His hands were floury with the stuff. He wiped them on his\\nchest, on his shoulders, on his bare arms. Delicious perfume! He shut his\\neyes; he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. Touch of smooth skin\\nagainst his face, scent in his nostrils of musky dust–her real presence.\\n\"Lenina,\" he whispered. \"Lenina!\"\\n\\n\\nA noise made him start, made him guiltily turn. He crammed up his\\nthieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid; then listened again, looked.\\nNot a sign of life, not a sound. And yet he had certainly heard\\nsomething–something like a sigh, something like the creak of a board. He\\ntiptoed to the door and, cautiously opening it, found himself looking on to a\\nbroad landing. On the opposite side of the landing was another door, ajar. He\\nstepped out, pushed, peeped.\\n\\n\\nThere, on a low bed, the sheet flung back, dressed in a pair of pink\\none-piece zippyjamas, lay Lenina, fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of\\nher curls, so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping\\nface, so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs, that\\nthe tears came to his eyes.\\n\\n\\nWith an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions–for nothing short of a\\npistol shot could have called Lenina back from her soma-holiday before\\nthe appointed time–he entered the room, he knelt on the floor beside the bed.\\nHe gazed, he clasped his hands, his lips moved. \"Her eyes,\" he murmured,\\n\\n\\n\"Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;\\nHandlest in thy discourse O! that her hand,\\nIn whose comparison all whites are ink\\nWriting their own reproach; to whose soft seizure\\nThe cygnet\\'s down is harsh …\"\\n\\n\\nA fly buzzed round her; he waved it away. \"Flies,\" he remembered,\\n\\n\\n\"On the white wonder of dear Juliet\\'s hand, may seize\\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty,\\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\"\\n\\n\\nVery slowly, with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to\\nstroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird, he put out his hand. It hung\\nthere trembling, within an inch of those limp fingers, on the verge of\\ncontact. Did he dare? Dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that … No, he\\ndidn\\'t. The bird was too dangerous. His hand dropped back. How beautiful she\\nwas! How beautiful!\\n\\n\\nThen suddenly he found himself reflecting that he had only to take hold of\\nthe zipper at her neck and give one long, strong pull … He shut his eyes, he\\nshook his head with the gesture of a dog shaking its ears as it emerges from\\nthe water. Detestable thought! He was ashamed of himself. Pure and vestal\\nmodesty …\\n\\n\\nThere was a humming in the air. Another fly trying to steal immortal\\nblessings? A wasp? He looked, saw nothing. The humming grew louder and louder,\\nlocalized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. The plane! In a\\npanic, he scrambled to his feet and ran into the other room, vaulted through\\nthe open window, and hurrying along the path between the tall agaves was in\\ntime to receive Bernard Marx as he climbed out of the helicopter.\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8\\n9\\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

Every one was busy, everything in ordered motion.\\nUnder the microscopes, their long tails furiously lashing, spermatozoa were\\nburrowing head first into eggs; and, fertilized, the eggs were expanding,\\ndividing, or if bokanovskified, budding and breaking up into whole populations\\nof separate embryos. From the Social Predestination Room the escalators went\\nrumbling down into the basement, and there, in the crimson darkness, stewingly\\nwarm on their cushion of peritoneum and gorged with blood-surrogate and\\nhormones, the foetuses grew and grew or, poisoned, languished into a stunted\\nEpsilonhood. With a faint hum and rattle the moving racks crawled\\nimperceptibly through the weeks and the recapitulated aeons to where, in the\\nDecanting Room, the newly-unbottled babes uttered their first yell of horror\\nand amazement.\\n\\nThe dynamos purred in the sub-basement, the lifts rushed up and down. On\\nall the eleven floors of Nurseries it was feeding time. From eighteen hundred\\nbottles eighteen hundred carefully labelled infants were simultaneously\\nsucking down their pint of pasteurized external secretion.\\n\\n\\nAbove them, in ten successive layers of dormitory, the little boys and\\ngirls who were still young enough to need an afternoon sleep were as busy as\\nevery one else, though they did not know it, listening unconsciously to\\nhypnopædic lessons in hygiene and sociability, in class-consciousness and the\\ntoddler\\'s love-life. Above these again were the playrooms where, the weather\\nhaving turned to rain, nine hundred older children were amusing themselves\\nwith bricks and clay modelling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play.\\n\\n\\nBuzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. Blithe was the singing\\nof the young girls over their test-tubes, the Predestinators whistled as they\\nworked, and in the Decanting Room what glorious jokes were cracked above the\\nempty bottles! But the Director\\'s face, as he entered the Fertilizing Room\\nwith Henry Foster, was grave, wooden with severity.\\n\\n\\n\"A public example,\" he was saying. \"In this room, because it contains more\\nhigh-caste workers than any other in the Centre. I have told him to meet me\\nhere at half-past two.\"\\n\\n\\n\"He does his work very well,\" put in Henry, with hypocritical generosity.\\n\\n\\n\"I know. But that\\'s all the more reason for severity. His intellectual\\neminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. The greater a\\nman\\'s talents, the greater his power to lead astray. It is better that one\\nshould suffer than that many should be corrupted. Consider the matter\\ndispassionately, Mr. Foster, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as\\nunorthodoxy of behaviour. Murder kills only the individual–and, after all,\\nwhat is an individual?\" With a sweeping gesture he indicated the rows of\\nmicroscopes, the test-tubes, the incubators. \"We can make a new one with the\\ngreatest ease–as many as we like. Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of\\na mere individual; it strikes at Society itself. Yes, at Society itself,\" he\\nrepeated. \"Ah, but here he comes.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of\\nfertilizers towards them. A veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly concealed\\nhis nervousness. The voice in which he said, \"Good-morning, Director,\" was\\nabsurdly too loud; that in which, correcting his mistake, he said, \"You asked\\nme to come and speak to you here,\" ridiculously soft, a squeak.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Marx,\" said the Director portentously. \"I did ask you to come to\\nme here. You returned from your holiday last night, I understand.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Bernard answered.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes-s,\" repeated the Director, lingering, a serpent, on the \"s.\" Then,\\nsuddenly raising his voice, \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he trumpeted, \"ladies and\\ngentlemen.\"\\n\\n\\nThe singing of the girls over their test-tubes, the preoccupied whistling\\nof the Microscopists, suddenly ceased. There was a profound silence; every one\\nlooked round.\\n\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the Director repeated once more, \"excuse me for\\nthus interrupting your labours. A painful duty constrains me. The security and\\nstability of Society are in danger. Yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. This\\nman,\" he pointed accusingly at Bernard, \"this man who stands before you here,\\nthis Alpha-Plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence,\\nso much must be expected, this colleague of yours–or should I anticipate and\\nsay this ex-colleague?–has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. By his\\nheretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his\\nsex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of Our Ford and behave out of\\noffice hours, \\'even as a little infant,\\'\" (here the Director made the sign of\\nthe T), \"he has proved himself an enemy of Society, a subverter, ladies and\\ngentlemen, of all Order and Stability, a conspirator against Civilization\\nitself. For this reason I propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy\\nfrom the post he has held in this Centre; I propose forthwith to apply for his\\ntransference to a Subcentre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may\\nserve the best interest of Society, as far as possible removed from any\\nimportant Centre of population. In Iceland he will have small opportunity to\\nlead others astray by his unfordly example.\" The Director paused; then,\\nfolding his arms, he turned impressively to Bernard. \"Marx,\" he said, \"can you\\nshow any reason why I should not now execute the judgment passed upon you?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I can,\" Bernard answered in a very loud voice.\\n\\n\\nSomewhat taken aback, but still majestically, \"Then show it,\" said the\\nDirector.\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly. But it\\'s in the passage. One moment.\" Bernard hurried to the\\ndoor and threw it open. \"Come in,\" he commanded, and the reason came in and\\nshowed itself.\\n\\n\\nThere was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl\\nscreamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset two\\ntest-tubes full of spermatozoa. Bloated, sagging, and among those firm\\nyouthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying monster of\\nmiddle-agedness, Linda advanced into the room, coquettishly smiling her broken\\nand discoloured smile, and rolling as she walked, with what was meant to be a\\nvoluptuous undulation, her enormous haunches. Bernard walked beside her.\\n\\n\\n\"There he is,\" he said, pointing at the Director.\\n\\n\\n\"Did you think I didn\\'t recognize him?\" Linda asked indignantly; then,\\nturning to the Director, \"Of course I knew you; Tomakin, I should have known\\nyou anywhere, among a thousand. But perhaps you\\'ve forgotten me. Don\\'t you\\nremember? Don\\'t you remember, Tomakin? Your Linda.\" She stood looking at him,\\nher head on one side, still smiling, but with a smile that became\\nprogressively, in face of the Director\\'s expression of petrified disgust, less\\nand less self-confident, that wavered and finally went out. \"Don\\'t you\\nremember, Tomakin?\" she repeated in a voice that trembled. Her eyes were\\nanxious, agonized. The blotched and sagging face twisted grotesquely into the\\ngrimace of extreme grief. \"Tomakin!\" She held out her arms. Some one began to\\ntitter.\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the meaning,\" began the Director, \"of this monstrous …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Tomakin!\" She ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her\\narms round his neck, hid her face on his chest.\\n\\n\\nA howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.\\n\\n\\n\"… this monstrous practical joke,\" the Director shouted.\\n\\n\\nRed in the face, he tried to disengage himself from her embrace.\\nDesperately she clung. \"But I\\'m Linda, I\\'m Linda.\"\\' The laughter drowned her\\nvoice. \"You made me have a baby,\" she screamed above the uproar. There was a\\nsudden and appalling hush; eyes floated uncomfortably, not knowing where to\\nlook. The Director went suddenly pale, stopped struggling and stood, his hands\\non her wrists, staring down at her, horrified. \"Yes, a baby–and I was its\\nmother.\" She flung the obscenity like a challenge into the outraged silence;\\nthen, suddenly breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with\\nher hands, sobbing. \"It wasn\\'t my fault, Tomakin. Because I always did my\\ndrill, didn\\'t I? Didn\\'t I? Always … I don\\'t know how … If you knew how awful,\\nTomakin … But he was a comfort to me, all the same.\" Turning towards the door,\\n\"John!\" she called. \"John!\"\\n\\n\\nHe came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked\\nround, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the room, fell\\non his knees in front of the Director, and said in a clear voice: \"My father!\"\\n\\n\\nThe word (for \"father\" was not so much obscene as–with its connotation of\\nsomething at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of\\nchild-bearing–merely gross, a scatological rather than a pornographic\\nimpropriety); the comically smutty word relieved what had become a quite\\nintolerable tension. Laughter broke out, enormous, almost hysterical, peal\\nafter peal, as though it would never stop. My father–and it was the Director!\\nMy father! Oh Ford, oh Ford! That was really too good. The whooping and\\nthe roaring renewed themselves, faces seemed on the point of disintegration,\\ntears were streaming. Six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. My\\nfather!\\n\\n\\nPale, wild-eyed, the Director glared about him in an agony of bewildered\\nhumiliation.\\n\\n\\nMy father! The laughter, which had shown signs of dying away, broke\\nout again more loudly than ever. He put his hands over his ears and rushed out\\nof the room.\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

To say one was a mother–that was\\npast a joke: it was an obscenity. Moreover, she wasn\\'t a real savage, had been\\nhatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else: so couldn\\'t have\\nreally quaint ideas. Finally–and this was by far the strongest reason for\\npeople\\'s not wanting to see poor Linda–there was her appearance. Fat; having\\nlost her youth; with bad teeth, and a blotched complexion, and that figure\\n(Ford!)–you simply couldn\\'t look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively\\nsick. So the best people were quite determined not to see Linda. And\\nLinda, for her part, had no desire to see them. The return to civilization was\\nfor her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and\\ntaking holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache\\nor a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt after\\npeyotl, as though you\\'d done something so shamefully anti-social that\\nyou could never hold up your head again. Soma played none of these\\nunpleasant tricks. The holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after\\nwas disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with\\nthe joys of the holiday. The remedy was to make the holiday continuous.\\nGreedily she clamoured for ever larger, ever more frequent doses. Dr. Shaw at\\nfirst demurred; then let her have what she wanted. She took as much as twenty\\ngrammes a day.\\n\\n\"Which will finish her off in a month or two,\" the doctor confided to\\nBernard. \"One day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. No more breathing.\\nFinished. And a good thing too. If we could rejuvenate, of course it would be\\ndifferent. But we can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\nSurprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday Linda was\\nmost conveniently out of the way), John raised objections.\\n\\n\\n\"But aren\\'t you shortening her life by giving her so much?\"\\n\\n\\n\"In one sense, yes,\" Dr. Shaw admitted. \"But in another we\\'re actually\\nlengthening it.\" The young man stared, uncomprehending. \"Soma may make\\nyou lose a few years in time,\" the doctor went on. \"But think of the enormous,\\nimmeasurable durations it can give you out of time. Every soma-holiday\\nis a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity.\"\\n\\n\\nJohn began to understand. \"Eternity was in our lips and eyes,\" he\\nmurmured.\\n\\n\\n\"Eh?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Dr. Shaw went on, \"you can\\'t allow people to go popping off\\ninto eternity if they\\'ve got any serious work to do. But as she hasn\\'t got any\\nserious work …\"\\n\\n\\n\"All the same,\" John persisted, \"I don\\'t believe it\\'s right.\"\\n\\n\\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, of course, if you prefer to have\\nher screaming mad all the time …\"\\n\\n\\nIn the end John was forced to give in. Linda got her soma.\\nThenceforward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of\\nBernard\\'s apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television always on,\\nand the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets within reach\\nof her hand–there she remained; and yet wasn\\'t there at all, was all the time\\naway, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in some other world, where\\nthe music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours, a sliding,\\npalpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beautifully inevitable windings) to a\\nbright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the\\ntelevision box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing\\nfeely; where the dripping patchouli was more than scent–was the sun, was a\\nmillion saxophones, was Popé making love, only much more so, incomparably\\nmore, and without end.\\n\\n\\n\"No, we can\\'t rejuvenate. But I\\'m very glad,\" Dr. Shaw had concluded, \"to\\nhave had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being.\\nThank you so much for calling me in.\" He shook Bernard warmly by the hand.\\n\\n\\nIt was John, then, they were all after. And as it was only through\\nBernard, his accredited guardian, that John could be seen, Bernard now found\\nhimself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, but as a\\nperson of outstanding importance. There was no more talk of the alcohol in his\\nblood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appearance. Henry Foster went out of\\nhis way to be friendly; Benito Hoover made him a present of six packets of\\nsex-hormone chewing-gum; the Assistant Predestinator came out and cadged\\nalmost abjectly for an invitation to one of Bernard\\'s evening parties. As for\\nthe women, Bernard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and\\nhe could have whichever of them he liked.\\n\\n\\n\"Bernard\\'s asked me to meet the Savage next Wednesday,\" Fanny announced\\ntriumphantly.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m so glad,\" said Lenina. \"And now you must admit that you were wrong\\nabout Bernard. Don\\'t you think he\\'s really rather sweet?\"\\n\\n\\nFanny nodded. \"And I must say,\" she said, \"I was quite agreeably\\nsurprised.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Chief Bottler, the Director of Predestination, three Deputy Assistant\\nFertilizer-Generals, the Professor of Feelies in the College of Emotional\\nEngineering, the Dean of the Westminster Community Singery, the Supervisor of\\nBokanovskification–the list of Bernard\\'s notabilities was interminable.\\n\\n\\n\"And I had six girls last week,\" he confided to Helmholtz Watson. \"One on\\nMonday, two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, and one on Saturday. And if I\\'d\\nhad the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen more who were\\nonly too anxious …\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapproving\\nthat Bernard was offended.\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re envious,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz shook his head. \"I\\'m rather sad, that\\'s all,\" he answered.\\n\\n\\nBernard went off in a huff. Never, he told himself, never would he speak\\nto Helmholtz again.\\n\\n\\nThe days passed. Success went fizzily to Bernard\\'s head, and in the\\nprocess completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a\\nworld which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. In so far as it\\nrecognized him as important, the order of things was good. But, reconciled by\\nhis success, he yet refused to forego the privilege of criticizing this order.\\nFor the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel\\nlarger. Moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to\\ncriticize. (At the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having\\nall the girls he wanted.) Before those who now, for the sake of the Savage,\\npaid their court to him, Bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. He was\\npolitely listened to. But behind his back people shook their heads. \"That\\nyoung man will come to a bad end,\" they said, prophesying the more confidently\\nin that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end\\nwas bad. \"He won\\'t find another Savage to help him out a second time,\" they\\nsaid. Meanwhile, however, there was the first Savage; they were polite. And\\nbecause they were polite, Bernard felt positively gigantic–gigantic and at the\\nsame time light with elation, lighter than air.\\n\\n\\n\"Lighter than air,\" said Bernard, pointing upwards.\\n\\n\\nLike a pearl in the sky, high, high above them, the Weather Department\\'s\\ncaptive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine.\\n\\n\\n\"… the said Savage,\" so ran Bernard\\'s instructions, \"to be shown civilized\\nlife in all its aspects. …\"\\n\\n\\nHe was being shown a bird\\'s-eye view of it at present, a bird\\'s-eye view\\nfrom the platform of the Charing-T Tower. The Station Master and the Resident\\nMeteorologist were acting as guides. But it was Bernard who did most of the\\ntalking. Intoxicated, he was behaving as though, at the very least, he were a\\nvisiting World Controller. Lighter than air.\\n\\n\\nThe Bombay Green Rocket dropped out of the sky. The passengers alighted.\\nEight identical Dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of\\nthe cabin–the stewards.\\n\\n\\n\"Twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour,\" said the Station Master\\nimpressively. \"What do you think of that, Mr. Savage?\"\\n\\n\\nJohn thought it very nice. \"Still,\" he said, \"Ariel could put a girdle\\nround the earth in forty minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The Savage,\" wrote Bernard in his report to Mustapha Mond, \"shows\\nsurprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. This is\\npartly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the\\nwoman Linda, his m–––.\"\\n\\n\\n(Mustapha Mond frowned. \"Does the fool think I\\'m too squeamish to see the\\nword written out at full length?\")\\n\\n\\n\"Partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls \\'the soul,\\' which\\nhe persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment,\\nwhereas, as I tried to point out to him …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the\\npage in search of something more interestingly concrete, when his eye was\\ncaught by a series of quite extraordinary phrases. \" … though I must admit,\"\\nhe read, \"that I agree with the Savage in finding civilized infantility too\\neasy or, as he puts it, not expensive enough; and I would like to take this\\nopportunity of drawing your fordship\\'s attention to …\"\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond\\'s anger gave place almost at once to mirth. The idea of this\\ncreature solemnly lecturing him–him-about the social order was really\\ntoo grotesque. The man must have gone mad. \"I ought to give him a lesson,\" he\\nsaid to himself; then threw back his head and laughed aloud. For the moment,\\nat any rate, the lesson would not be given.\\n\\n\\nIt was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters, a branch of the\\nElectrical Equipment Corporation. They were met on the roof itself (for that\\ncircular letter of recommendation from the Controller was magical in its\\neffects) by the Chief Technician and the Human Element Manager. They walked\\ndownstairs into the factory.\\n\\n\\n\"Each process,\" explained the Human Element Manager, \"is carried out, so\\nfar as possible, by a single Bokanovsky Group.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas\\nwere cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines\\nwere being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred\\nand seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese were working in the foundry.\\nThirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all\\nwithin 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In\\nthe assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of\\nGamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them\\ncrawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads\\nwere confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven\\nhooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed\\nmechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma\\ngreen, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male\\nDelta-Minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three\\nblue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.\\n\\n\\n\"O brave new world …\" By some malice of his memory the Savage found\\nhimself repeating Miranda\\'s words. \"O brave new world that has such people in\\nit.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And I assure you,\" the Human Element Manager concluded, as they left the\\nfactory, \"we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. We always find …\"\\n\\n\\nBut the Savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was\\nviolently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid earth had\\nbeen a helicopter in an air pocket.\\n\\n\\n\"The Savage,\" wrote Bernard, \"refuses to take soma, and seems much\\ndistressed because of the woman Linda, his m–––, remains permanently on\\nholiday. It is worthy of note that, in spite of his m–––\\'s senility and the\\nextreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the Savage frequently goes to see her\\nand appears to be much attached to her–an interesting example of the way in\\nwhich early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural\\nimpulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).\"\\n\\n\\nAt Eton they alighted on the roof of Upper School. On the opposite side of\\nSchool Yard, the fifty-two stories of Lupton\\'s Tower gleamed white in the\\nsunshine. College on their left and, on their right, the School Community\\nSingery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. In the\\ncentre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of Our Ford.\\n\\n\\nDr. Gaffney, the Provost, and Miss Keate, the Head Mistress, received them\\nas they stepped out of the plane.\\n\\n\\n\"Do you have many twins here?\" the Savage asked rather apprehensively, as\\nthey set out on their tour of inspection.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" the Provost answered. \"Eton is reserved exclusively for\\nupper-caste boys and girls. One egg, one adult. It makes education more\\ndifficult of course. But as they\\'ll be called upon to take responsibilities\\nand deal with unexpected emergencies, it can\\'t be helped.\" He sighed.\\n\\n\\nBernard, meanwhile, had taken a strong fancy to Miss Keate. \"If you\\'re\\nfree any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening,\" he was saying. Jerking his\\nthumb towards the Savage, \"He\\'s curious, you know,\" Bernard added. \"Quaint.\"\\n\\n\\nMiss Keate smiled (and her smile was really charming, he thought); said\\nThank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. The Provost\\nopened a door.\\n\\n\\nFive minutes in that Alpha Double Plus classroom left John a trifle\\nbewildered.\\n\\n\\n\"What is elementary relativity?\" he whispered to Bernard. Bernard\\ntried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they should go\\nto some other classroom.\\n\\n\\nFrom behind a door in the corridor leading to the Beta-Minus geography\\nroom, a ringing soprano voice called, \"One, two, three, four,\" and then, with\\na weary impatience, \"As you were.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Malthusian Drill,\" explained the Head Mistress. \"Most of our girls are\\nfreemartins, of course. I\\'m a freemartin myself.\" She smiled at Bernard. \"But\\nwe have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.\"\\n\\n\\nIn the Beta-Minus geography room John learnt that \"a savage reservation is\\na place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions, or\\npoverty of natural resources, has not been worth the expense of civilizing.\" A\\nclick; the room was darkened; and suddenly, on the screen above the Master\\'s\\nhead, there were the Penitentes of Acoma prostrating themselves before\\nOur Lady, and wailing as John had heard them wail, confessing their sins\\nbefore Jesus on the Cross, before the eagle image of Pookong. The young\\nEtonians fairly shouted with laughter. Still wailing, the Penitentes\\nrose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips,\\nbegan to beat themselves, blow after blow. Redoubled, the laughter drowned\\neven the amplified record of their groans.\\n\\n\\n\"But why do they laugh?\" asked the Savage in a pained bewilderment.\\n\\n\\n\"Why?\" The Provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face.\\n\"Why? But because it\\'s so extraordinarily funny.\"\\n\\n\\nIn the cinematographic twilight, Bernard risked a gesture which, in the\\npast, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. Strong in\\nhis new importance, he put his arm around the Head Mistress\\'s waist. It\\nyielded, willowily. He was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a\\ngentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again.\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps we had better go on,\" said Miss Keate, and moved towards the\\ndoor.\\n\\n\\n\"And this,\" said the Provost a moment later, \"is Hypnopædic Control Room.\"\\n\\n\\nHundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in\\nshelves round three sides of the room; pigeon-holed on the fourth were the\\npaper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnopædic lessons were printed.\\n\\n\\n\"You slip the roll in here,\" explained Bernard, interrupting Dr. Gaffney,\\n\"press down this switch …\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, that one,\" corrected the Provost, annoyed.\\n\\n\\n\"That one, then. The roll unwinds. The selenium cells transform the light\\nimpulses into sound waves, and …\"\\n\\n\\n\"And there you are,\" Dr. Gaffney concluded.\\n\\n\\n\"Do they read Shakespeare?\" asked the Savage as they walked, on their way\\nto the Bio-chemical Laboratories, past the School Library.\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly not,\" said the Head Mistress, blushing.\\n\\n\\n\"Our library,\" said Dr. Gaffney, \"contains only books of reference. If our\\nyoung people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. We don\\'t\\nencourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.\"\\n\\n\\nFive bus-loads of boys and girls, singing or in a silent embracement,\\nrolled past them over the vitrified highway.\\n\\n\\n\"Just returned,\" explained Dr. Gaffney, while Bernard, whispering, made an\\nappointment with the Head Mistress for that very evening, \"from the Slough\\nCrematorium. Death conditioning begins at eighteen months. Every tot spends\\ntwo mornings a week in a Hospital for the Dying. All the best toys are kept\\nthere, and they get chocolate cream on death days. They learn to take dying as\\na matter of course.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Like any other physiological process,\" put in the Head Mistress\\nprofessionally.\\n\\n\\nEight o\\'clock at the Savoy. It was all arranged.\\n\\n\\nOn their way back to London they stopped at the Television Corporation\\'s\\nfactory at Brentford.\\n\\n\\n\"Do you mind waiting here a moment while I go and telephone?\" asked\\nBernard.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage waited and watched. The Main Day-Shift was just going off duty.\\nCrowds of lower-caste workers were queued up in front of the monorail\\nstation-seven or eight hundred Gamma, Delta and Epsilon men and women, with\\nnot more than a dozen faces and statures between them. To each of them, with\\nhis or her ticket, the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pillbox.\\nThe long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward.\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s in those\" (remembering The Merchant of Venice) \"those\\ncaskets?\" the Savage enquired when Bernard had rejoined him.\\n\\n\\n\"The day\\'s soma ration,\" Bernard answered rather indistinctly; for\\nhe was masticating a piece of Benito Hoover\\'s chewing-gum. \"They get it after\\ntheir work\\'s over. Four half-gramme tablets. Six on Saturdays.\"\\n\\n\\nHe took John\\'s arm affectionately and they walked back towards the\\nhelicopter.\\n\\n\\nLenina came singing into the Changing Room.\\n\\n\\n\"You seem very pleased with yourself,\" said Fanny.\\n\\n\\n\"I am pleased,\" she answered. Zip! \"Bernard rang up half an hour\\nago.\" Zip, zip! She stepped out of her shorts. \"He has an unexpected\\nengagement.\" Zip! \"Asked me if I\\'d take the Savage to the feelies this\\nevening. I must fly.\" She hurried away towards the bathroom.\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'s a lucky girl,\" Fanny said to herself as she watched Lenina go.\\n\\n\\nThere was no envy in the comment; good-natured Fanny was merely stating a\\nfact. Lenina was lucky; lucky in having shared with Bernard a generous portion\\nof the Savage\\'s immense celebrity, lucky in reflecting from her insignificant\\nperson the moment\\'s supremely fashionable glory. Had not the Secretary of the\\nYoung Women\\'s Fordian Association asked her to give a lecture about her\\nexperiences? Had she not been invited to the Annual Dinner of the Aphroditeum\\nClub? Had she not already appeared in the Feelytone News–visibly, audibly and\\ntactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet?\\n\\n\\nHardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous\\nindividuals. The Resident World Controller\\'s Second Secretary had asked her to\\ndinner and breakfast. She had spent one week-end with the Ford Chief-Justice,\\nand another with the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. The President of\\nthe Internal and External Secretions Corporation was perpetually on the phone,\\nand she had been to Deauville with the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of Europe.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s wonderful, of course. And yet in a way,\" she had confessed to Fanny,\\n\"I feel as though I were getting something on false pretences. Because, of\\ncourse, the first thing they all want to know is what it\\'s like to make love\\nto a Savage. And I have to say I don\\'t know.\" She shook her head. \"Most of the\\nmen don\\'t believe me, of course. But it\\'s true. I wish it weren\\'t,\" she added\\nsadly and sighed. \"He\\'s terribly good-looking; don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\\n\\n\"But doesn\\'t he like you?\" asked Fanny.\\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn\\'t. He always\\ndoes his best to avoid me; goes out of the room when I come in; won\\'t touch\\nme; won\\'t even look at me. But sometimes if I turn round suddenly, I catch him\\nstaring; and then–well, you know how men look when they like you.\"\\n\\n\\nYes, Fanny knew.\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t make it out,\" said Lenina.\\n\\n\\nShe couldn\\'t make it out; and not only was bewildered; was also rather\\nupset.\\n\\n\\n\"Because, you see, Fanny, I like him.\"\\n\\n\\nLiked him more and more. Well, now there\\'d be a real chance, she thought,\\nas she scented herself after her bath. Dab, dab, dab–a real chance. Her high\\nspirits overflowed in a song.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'Hug me till you drug me, honey;\\nKiss me till I\\'m in a coma;\\nHug me, honey, snuggly bunny;\\nLove\\'s as good as soma.\"\\n\\n\\nThe scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing Herbal\\nCapriccio–rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil,\\nmyrtle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into\\nambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and newmown\\nhay (with occasional subtle touches of discord–a whiff of kidney pudding, the\\nfaintest suspicion of pig\\'s dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the\\npiece began. The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of\\napplause; the lights went up. In the synthetic music machine the sound-track\\nroll began to unwind. It was a trio for hyper-violin, super-cello and\\noboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. Thirty or\\nforty bars–and then, against this instrumental background, a much more than\\nhuman voice began to warble; now throaty, now from the head, now hollow as a\\nflute, now charged with yearning harmonics, it effortlessly passed from\\nGaspard\\'s Forster\\'s low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a\\ntrilled bat-note high above the highest C to which (in 1770, at the Ducal\\nopera of Parma, and to the astonishment of Mozart) Lucrezia Ajugari, alone of\\nall the singers in history, once piercingly gave utterance.\\n\\n\\nSunk in their pneumatic stalls, Lenina and the Savage sniffed and\\nlistened. It was now the turn also for eyes and skin.\\n\\n\\nThe house lights went down; fiery letters stood out solid and as though\\nself-supported in the darkness. THREE WEEKS IN A HELICOPTER . AN\\nALL-SUPER-SINGING, SYNTHETIC-TALK1NG, COLOURED, STEREOSCOPIC FEELY. WITH\\nSYNCHRONIZED SCENT-ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT.\\n\\n\\n\"Take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair,\" whispered\\nLenina. \"Otherwise you won\\'t get any of the feely effects.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage did as he was told.\\n\\n\\nThose fiery letters, meanwhile, had disappeared; there were ten seconds of\\ncomplete darkness; then suddenly, dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking\\nthan they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood, far more real than\\nreality, there stood the stereoscopic images, locked in one another\\'s arms, of\\na gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic Beta-Plus female.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage started. That sensation on his lips! He lifted a hand to his\\nmouth; the titillation ceased; let his hand fall back on the metal knob; it\\nbegan again. The scent organ, meanwhile, breathed pure musk. Expiringly, a\\nsound-track super-dove cooed \"Oo-ooh\"; and vibrating only thirty-two times a\\nsecond, a deeper than African bass made answer: \"Aa-aah.\" \"Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!\"\\nthe stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous\\nzones of the six thousand spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost\\nintolerable galvanic pleasure. \"Ooh …\"\\n\\n\\nThe plot of the film was extremely simple. A few minutes after the first\\nOohs and Aahs (a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous\\nbearskin, every hair of which–the Assistant Predestinator was perfectly\\nright–could be separately and distinctly felt), the negro had a helicopter\\naccident, fell on his head. Thump! what a twinge through the forehead! A chorus\\nof ow\\'s and aie\\'s went up from the audience.\\n\\n\\nThe concussion knocked all the negro\\'s conditioning into a cocked hat. He\\ndeveloped for the Beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. She\\nprotested. He persisted. There were struggles, pursuits, an assault on a\\nrival, finally a sensational kidnapping. The Beta blond was ravished away into\\nthe sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks in a wildly anti-social\\ntête-à-tête with the black madman. Finally, after a whole series of\\nadventures and much aerial acrobacy three handsome young Alphas succeeded in\\nrescuing her. The negro was packed off to an Adult Re-conditioning Centre and\\nthe film ended happily and decorously, with the Beta blonde becoming the\\nmistress of all her three rescuers. They interrupted themselves for a moment\\nto sing a synthetic quartet, with full super-orchestral accompaniment and\\ngardenias on the scent organ. Then the bearskin made a final appearance and,\\namid a blare of saxophones, the last stereoscopic kiss faded into darkness,\\nthe last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers,\\nquivers, ever more feebly, ever more faintly, and at last is quiet, quite\\nstill.\\n\\n\\nBut for Lenina the moth did not completely die. Even after the lights had\\ngone up, while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the\\nlifts, its ghost still fluttered against her lips, still traced fine\\nshuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. Her cheeks were\\nflushed. She caught hold of the Savage\\'s arm and pressed it, limp, against her\\nside. He looked down at her for a moment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed\\nof his desire. He was not worthy, not … Their eyes for a moment met. What\\ntreasures hers promised! A queen\\'s ransom of temperament. Hastily he looked\\naway, disengaged his imprisoned arm. He was obscurely terrified lest she\\nshould cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of.\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think you ought to see things like that,\" he said, making haste\\nto transfer from Lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for\\nany past or possible future lapse from perfection.\\n\\n\\n\"Things like what, John?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Like this horrible film.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Horrible?\" Lenina was genuinely astonished. \"But I thought it was\\nlovely.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It was base,\" he said indignantly, \"it was ignoble.\"\\n\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"I don\\'t know what you mean.\" Why was he so queer? Why\\ndid he go out of his way to spoil things?\\n\\n\\nIn the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. Bound by strong vows that\\nhad never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run,\\nhe sat averted and in silence. Sometimes, as though a finger had plucked at\\nsome taut, almost breaking string, his whole body would shake with a sudden\\nnervous start.\\n\\n\\nThe taxicopter landed on the roof of Lenina\\'s apartment house. \"At last,\"\\nshe thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. At last–even though he\\nhad been so queer just now. Standing under a lamp, she peered into her\\nhand mirror. At last. Yes, her nose was a bit shiny. She shook the loose\\npowder from her puff. While he was paying off the taxi–there would just be\\ntime. She rubbed at the shininess, thinking: \"He\\'s terribly good-looking. No\\nneed for him to be shy like Bernard. And yet … Any other man would have done\\nit long ago. Well, now at last.\" That fragment of a face in the little round\\nmirror suddenly smiled at her.\\n\\n\\n\"Good-night,\" said a strangled voice behind her. Lenina wheeled round. He\\nwas standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had evidently\\nbeen staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, waiting–but what\\nfor? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and all the time thinking,\\nthinking–she could not imagine what extraordinary thoughts. \"Good-night,\\nLenina,\" he repeated, and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile.\\n\\n\\n\"But, John … I thought you were … I mean, aren\\'t you? …\"\\n\\n\\nHe shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. The cab\\nshot up into the air.\\n\\n\\nLooking down through the window in the floor, the Savage could see\\nLenina\\'s upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. The mouth was\\nopen, she was calling. Her foreshortened figure rushed away from him; the\\ndiminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness.\\n\\n\\nFive minutes later he was back in his room. From its hiding-place he took\\nout his mouse-nibbled volume, turned with religious care its stained and\\ncrumbled pages, and began to read Othello. Othello, he remembered, was\\nlike the hero of Three Weeks in a Helicopter–a black man.\\n\\n\\nDrying her eyes, Lenina walked across the roof to the lift. On her way\\ndown to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. One\\ngramme, she decided, would not be enough; hers had been more than a one-gramme\\naffliction.

The men were furious at having been\\ntricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury\\nreputation and the heretical opinions. The higher their position in the\\nhierarchy, the deeper their resentment.\\n\\n\\n\"To play such a joke on me,\" the Arch-Songster kept repeating, \"on\\nme!\"\\n\\n\\nAs for the women, they indignantly felt that they had been had on false\\npretences–had by a wretched little man who had had alcohol poured into his\\nbottle by mistake–by a creature with a Gamma-Minus physique. It was an\\noutrage, and they said so, more and more loudly. The Head Mistress of Eton was\\nparticularly scathing.\\n\\n\\nLenina alone said nothing. Pale, her blue eyes clouded with an unwonted\\nmelancholy, she sat in a corner, cut off from those who surrounded her by an\\nemotion which they did not share. She had come to the party filled with a\\nstrange feeling of anxious exultation. \"In a few minutes,\" she had said to\\nherself, as she entered the room, \"I shall be seeing him, talking to him,\\ntelling him\" (for she had come with her mind made up) \"that I like him–more\\nthan anybody I\\'ve ever known. And then perhaps he\\'ll say …\"\\n\\n\\nWhat would he say? The blood had rushed to her cheeks.\\n\\n\\n\"Why was he so strange the other night, after the feelies? So queer. And\\nyet I\\'m absolutely sure he really does rather like me. I\\'m sure …\"\\n\\n\\nIt was at this moment that Bernard had made his announcement; the Savage\\nwasn\\'t coming to the party.\\n\\n\\nLenina suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the\\nbeginning of a Violent Passion Surrogate treatment–a sense of dreadful\\nemptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. Her heart seemed to stop\\nbeating.\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s because he doesn\\'t like me,\" she said to herself. And at\\nonce this possibility became an established certainty: John had refused to\\ncome because he didn\\'t like her. He didn\\'t like her. …\\n\\n\\n\"It really is a bit too thick,\" the Head Mistress of Eton was\\nsaying to the Director of Crematoria and Phosphorus Reclamation. \"When I think\\nthat I actually …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" came the voice of Fanny Crowne, \"it\\'s absolutely true about the\\nalcohol. Some one I know knew some one who was working in the Embryo Store at\\nthe time. She said to my friend, and my friend said to me …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Too bad, too bad,\" said Henry Foster, sympathizing with the\\nArch-Community-Songster. \"It may interest you to know that our ex-Director was\\non the point of transferring him to Iceland.\"\\n\\n\\nPierced by every word that was spoken, the tight balloon of Bernard\\'s\\nhappy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. Pale, distraught,\\nabject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering incoherent\\napologies, assuring them that next time the Savage would certainly be there,\\nbegging them to sit down and take a carotene sandwich, a slice of vitamin A\\npâté, a glass of champagne-surrogate. They duly ate, but ignored him;\\ndrank and were either rude to his face or talked to one another about him,\\nloudly and offensively, as though he had not been there.\\n\\n\\n\"And now, my friends,\" said the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, in\\nthat beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings at Ford\\'s Day\\nCelebrations, \"Now, my friends, I think perhaps the time has come …\" He rose,\\nput down his glass, brushed from his purple viscose waistcoat the crumbs of a\\nconsiderable collation, and walked towards the door.\\n\\n\\nBernard darted forward to intercept him.\\n\\n\\n\"Must you really, Arch-Songster? … It\\'s very early still. I\\'d hoped you\\nwould …\"\\n\\n\\nYes, what hadn\\'t he hoped, when Lenina confidentially told him that the\\nArch-Community-Songster would accept an invitation if it were sent. \"He\\'s\\nreally rather sweet, you know.\" And she had shown Bernard the little golden\\nzipper-fastening in the form of a T which the Arch-Songster had given her as a\\nmemento of the week-end she had spent at Lambeth. To meet the\\nArch-Community-Songster of Canterbury and Mr. Savage. Bernard had\\nproclaimed his triumph on every invitation card. But the Savage had chosen\\nthis evening of all evenings to lock himself up in his room, to shout\\n\"Háni!\" and even (it was lucky that Bernard didn\\'t understand Zuñi)\\n\"Sons éso tse-ná!\" What should have been the crowning moment of\\nBernard\\'s whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest\\nhumiliation.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d so much hoped …\" he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the great\\ndignitary with pleading and distracted eyes.\\n\\n\\n\"My young friend,\" said the Arch-Community-Songster in a tone of loud and\\nsolemn severity; there was a general silence. \"Let me give you a word of\\nadvice.\" He wagged his finger at Bernard. \"Before it\\'s too late. A word of\\ngood advice.\" (His voice became sepulchral.) \"Mend your ways, my young friend,\\nmend your ways.\" He made the sign of the T over him and turned away. \"Lenina,\\nmy dear,\" he called in another tone. \"Come with me.\"\\n\\n\\nObediently, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to\\nher) without elation, Lenina walked after him, out of the room. The other\\nguests followed at a respectful interval. The last of them slammed the door.\\nBernard was all alone.\\n\\n\\nPunctured, utterly deflated, he dropped into a chair and, covering his\\nface with his hands, began to weep. A few minutes later, however, he thought\\nbetter of it and took four tablets of soma.\\n\\n\\nUpstairs in his room the Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet.\\n\\n\\nLenina and the Arch-Community-Songster stepped out on to the roof of\\nLambeth Palace. \"Hurry up, my young friend–I mean, Lenina,\" called the\\nArch-Songster impatiently from the lift gates. Lenina, who had lingered for a\\nmoment to look at the moon, dropped her eyes and came hurrying across the roof\\nto rejoin him.\\n\\n\\n\"A New Theory of Biology\" was the title of the paper which Mustapha Mond\\nhad just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then\\npicked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: \"The author\\'s mathematical\\ntreatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but\\nheretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and\\npotentially subversive. Not to be published.\" He underlined the words.\\n\"The author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine\\nBiological Station of St. Helena may become necessary.\" A pity, he thought, as\\nhe signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began\\nadmitting explanations in terms of purpose–well, you didn\\'t know what the\\nresult might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the\\nmore unsettled minds among the higher castes–make them lose their faith in\\nhappiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal\\nwas somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere, that the\\npurpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some\\nintensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge.\\nWhich was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the\\npresent circumstance, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the\\nwords \"Not to be published\" drew a second line, thicker and blacker\\nthan the first; then sighed, \"What fun it would be,\" he thought, \"if one\\ndidn\\'t have to think about happiness!\"\\n\\n\\nWith closed eyes, his face shining with rapture, John was softly\\ndeclaiming to vacancy:\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! she doth teach the torches to burn bright.\\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night,\\nLike a rich jewel in an Ethiop\\'s ear;\\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear …\"\\n\\n\\nThe golden T lay shining on Lenina\\'s bosom. Sportively, the\\nArch-Community-Songster caught hold of it, sportively he pulled, pulled. \"I\\nthink,\" said Lenina suddenly, breaking a long silence, \"I\\'d better take a\\ncouple of grammes of soma.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard, by this time, was fast asleep and smiling at the private paradise\\nof his dreams. Smiling, smiling. But inexorably, every thirty seconds, the\\nminute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost\\nimperceptible click. Click, click, click, click … And it was morning. Bernard\\nwas back among the miseries of space and time. It was in the lowest spirits\\nthat he taxied across to his work at the Conditioning Centre. The intoxication\\nof success had evaporated; he was soberly his old self; and by contrast with\\nthe temporary balloon of these last weeks, the old self seemed unprecedentedly\\nheavier than the surrounding atmosphere.\\n\\n\\nTo this deflated Bernard the Savage showed himself unexpectedly\\nsympathetic.\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re more like what you were at Malpais,\" he said, when Bernard had\\ntold him his plaintive story. \"Do you remember when we first talked together?\\nOutside the little house. You\\'re like what you were then.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because I\\'m unhappy again; that\\'s why.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness\\nyou were having here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I like that,\" said Bernard bitterly. \"When it\\'s you who were the cause of\\nit all. Refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me!\" He\\nknew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice; he admitted\\ninwardly, and at last even aloud, the truth of all that the Savage now said\\nabout the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a\\nprovocation into persecuting enemies. But in spite of this knowledge and these\\nadmissions, in spite of the fact that his friend\\'s support and sympathy were\\nnow his only comfort, Bernard continued perversely to nourish, along with his\\nquite genuine affection, a secret grievance against the Savage, to mediate a\\ncampaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. Nourishing a grievance\\nagainst the Arch-Community-Songster was useless; there was no possibility of\\nbeing revenged on the Chief Bottler or the Assistant Predestinator. As a\\nvictim, the Savage possessed, for Bernard, this enormous superiority over the\\nothers: that he was accessible. One of the principal functions of a friend is\\nto suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like,\\nbut are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.\\n\\n\\nBernard\\'s other victim-friend was Helmholtz. When, discomfited, he came\\nand asked once more for the friendship which, in his prosperity, he had not\\nthought it worth his while to preserve. Helmholtz gave it; and gave it without\\na reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever\\nbeen a quarrel. Touched, Bernard felt himself at the same time humiliated by\\nthis magnanimity–a magnanimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more\\nhumiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to\\nHelmholtz\\'s character. It was the Helmholtz of daily life who forgot and\\nforgave, not the Helmholtz of a half-gramme holiday. Bernard was duly grateful\\n(it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again) and also duly resentful\\n(it would be pleasure to take some revenge on Helmholtz for his generosity).\\n\\n\\nAt their first meeting after the estrangement, Bernard poured out the tale\\nof his miseries and accepted consolation. It was not till some days later that\\nhe learned, to his surprise and with a twinge of shame, that he was not the\\nonly one who had been in trouble. Helmholtz had also come into conflict with\\nAuthority.\\n\\n\\n\"It was over some rhymes,\" he explained. \"I was giving my usual course of\\nAdvanced Emotional Engineering for Third Year Students. Twelve lectures, of\\nwhich the seventh is about rhymes. \\'On the Use of Rhymes in Moral Propaganda\\nand Advertisement,\\' to be precise. I always illustrate my lecture with a lot\\nof technical examples. This time I thought I\\'d give them one I\\'d just written\\nmyself. Pure madness, of course; but I couldn\\'t resist it.\" He laughed. \"I was\\ncurious to see what their reactions would be. Besides,\" he added more gravely,\\n\"I wanted to do a bit of propaganda; I was trying to engineer them into\\nfeeling as I\\'d felt when I wrote the rhymes. Ford!\" He laughed again. \"What an\\noutcry there was! The Principal had me up and threatened to hand me the\\nimmediate sack. l\\'m a marked man.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But what were your rhymes?\" Bernard asked.\\n\\n\\n\"They were about being alone.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard\\'s eyebrows went up.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll recite them to you, if you like.\" And Helmholtz began:\\n\\n\\n\"Yesterday\\'s committee,\\nSticks, but a broken drum,\\nMidnight in the City,\\nFlutes in a vacuum,\\nShut lips, sleeping faces,\\nEvery stopped machine,\\nThe dumb and littered places\\nWhere crowds have been: …\\nAll silences rejoice,\\nWeep (loudly or low),\\nSpeak–but with the voice\\nOf whom, I do not know.\\nAbsence, say, of Susan\\'s,\\nAbsence of Egeria\\'s\\nArms and respective bosoms,\\nLips and, ah, posteriors,\\nSlowly form a presence;\\nWhose? and, I ask, of what\\nSo absurd an essence,\\nThat something, which is not,\\nNevertheless should populate\\nEmpty night more solidly\\nThan that with which we copulate,\\nWhy should it seem so squalidly?\\n\\n\\nWell, I gave them that as an example, and they reported me to the\\nPrincipal.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not surprised,\" said Bernard. \"It\\'s flatly against all their\\nsleep-teaching. Remember, they\\'ve had at least a quarter of a million warnings\\nagainst solitude.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I know. But I thought I\\'d like to see what the effect would be.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ve seen now.\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz only laughed. \"I feel,\" he said, after a silence, as though I\\nwere just beginning to have something to write about. As though I were\\nbeginning to be able to use that power I feel I\\'ve got inside me–that extra,\\nlatent power. Something seems to be coming to me.\" In spite of all his\\ntroubles, he seemed, Bernard thought, profoundly happy.\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz and the Savage took to one another at once. So cordially indeed\\nthat Bernard felt a sharp pang of jealousy. In all these weeks he had never\\ncome to so close an intimacy with the Savage as Helmholtz immediately\\nachieved. Watching them, listening to their talk, he found himself sometimes\\nresentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. He was ashamed of\\nhis jealousy and alternately made efforts of will and took soma to keep\\nhimself from feeling it. But the efforts were not very successful; and between\\nthe soma-holidays there were, of necessity, intervals. The odious\\nsentiment kept on returning.\\n\\n\\nAt his third meeting with the Savage, Helmholtz recited his rhymes on\\nSolitude.\\n\\n\\n\"What do you think of them?\" he asked when he had done.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage shook his head. \"Listen to this,\" was his answer; and unlocking\\nthe drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book, he opened and read:\\n\\n\\n\"Let the bird of loudest lay\\nOn the sole Arabian tree,\\nHerald sad and trumpet be …\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz listened with a growing excitement. At \"sole Arabian tree\" he\\nstarted; at \"thou shrieking harbinger\" he smiled with sudden pleasure; at\\n\"every fowl of tyrant wing\" the blood rushed up into his cheeks; but at\\n\"defunctive music\" he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion.\\nThe Savage read on:\\n\\n\\n\"Property was thus appall\\'d,\\nThat the self was not the same;\\nSingle nature\\'s double name\\nNeither two nor one was call\\'d\\nReason in itself confounded\\nSaw division grow together …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Orgy-porgy!\" said Bernard, interrupting the reading with a loud,\\nunpleasant laugh. \"It\\'s just a Solidarity Service hymn.\" He was revenging\\nhimself on his two friends for liking one another more than they liked him.\\n\\n\\nIn the course of their next two or three meetings he frequently repeated\\nthis little act of vengeance. It was simple and, since both Helmholtz and the\\nSavage were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite\\npoetic crystal, extremely effective. In the end, Helmholtz threatened to kick\\nhim out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. And yet, strangely enough,\\nthe next interruption, the most disgraceful of all, came from Helmholtz\\nhimself.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet aloud–reading (for all the\\ntime he was seeing himself as Romeo and Lenina as Juliet) with an intense and\\nquivering passion. Helmholtz had listened to the scene of the lovers\\' first\\nmeeting with a puzzled interest. The scene in the orchard had delighted him\\nwith its poetry; but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. Getting into\\nsuch a state about having a girl–it seemed rather ridiculous. But, taken\\ndetail by verbal detail, what a superb piece of emotional engineering! \"That\\nold fellow,\" he said, \"he makes our best propaganda technicians look\\nabsolutely silly.\" The Savage smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading. All\\nwent tolerably well until, in the last scene of the third act, Capulet and\\nLady Capulet began to bully Juliet to marry Paris. Helmholtz had been restless\\nthroughout the entire scene; but when, pathetically mimed by the Savage,\\nJuliet cried out:\\n\\n\\n\"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,\\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\\nO sweet my mother, cast me not away:\\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week;\\nOr, if you do not, make the bridal bed\\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies …\"\\n\\nwhen Juliet said this, Helmholtz broke out in an explosion of\\nuncontrollable guffawing.\\n\\nThe mother and father (grotesque obscenity) forcing the daughter to have\\nsome one she didn\\'t want! And the idiotic girl not saying that she was having\\nsome one else whom (for the moment, at any rate) she preferred! In its smutty\\nabsurdity the situation was irresistibly comical. He had managed, with a\\nheroic effort, to hold down the mounting pressure of his hilarity; but \"sweet\\nmother\" (in the Savage\\'s tremulous tone of anguish) and the reference to\\nTybalt lying dead, but evidently uncremated and wasting his phosphorus on a\\ndim monument, were too much for him. He laughed and laughed till the tears\\nstreamed down his face–quenchlessly laughed while, pale with a sense of\\noutrage, the Savage looked at him over the top of his book and then, as the\\nlaughter still continued, closed it indignantly, got up and, with the gesture\\nof one who removes his pearl from before swine, locked it away in its drawer.\\n\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Helmholtz when, having recovered breath enough to\\napologize, he had mollified the Savage into listening to his explanations, \"I\\nknow quite well that one needs ridiculous, mad situations like that; one can\\'t\\nwrite really well about anything else. Why was that old fellow such a\\nmarvellous propaganda technician? Because he had so many insane, excruciating\\nthings to get excited about. You\\'ve got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you\\ncan\\'t think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases. But fathers and\\nmothers!\" He shook his head. \"You can\\'t expect me to keep a straight face\\nabout fathers and mothers. And who\\'s going to get excited about a boy having a\\ngirl or not having her?\" (The Savage winced; but Helmholtz, who was staring\\npensively at the floor, saw nothing.) \"No.\" he concluded, with a sigh, \"it\\nwon\\'t do. We need some other kind of madness and violence. But what? What?\\nWhere can one find it?\" He was silent; then, shaking his head, \"I don\\'t know,\"\\nhe said at last, \"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

In\\nthe end, she decided not to run the risk of letting it have a second dose, and\\nmoved down the line to the next bottle.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-two years, eight months, and four days from that moment, a\\npromising young Alpha-Minus administrator at Mwanza-Mwanza was to die of\\ntrypanosomiasis–the first case for over half a century.

And now\\nI\\'m going to have my bath.\" She marched off, trailing her towel.\\n\\n\\nThe bell rang, and the Savage, who was impatiently hoping that Helmholtz\\nwould come that afternoon (for having at last made up his mind to talk to\\nHelmholtz about Lenina, he could not bear to postpone his confidences a moment\\nlonger), jumped up and ran to the door.\\n\\n\\n\"I had a premonition it was you, Helmholtz,\" he shouted as he opened.\\n\\n\\nOn the threshold, in a white acetate-satin sailor suit, and with a round\\nwhite cap rakishly tilted over her left ear, stood Lenina.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said the Savage, as though some one had struck him a heavy blow.\\n\\n\\nHalf a gramme had been enough to make Lenina forget her fears and her\\nembarrassments. \"Hullo, John,\" she said, smiling, and walked past him into the\\nroom. Automatically he closed the door and followed her. Lenina sat down.\\nThere was a long silence.\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t seem very glad to see me, John,\" she said at last.\\n\\n\\n\"Not glad?\" The Savage looked at her reproachfully; then suddenly fell on\\nhis knees before her and, taking Lenina\\'s hand, reverently kissed it. \"Not\\nglad? Oh, if you only knew,\" he whispered and, venturing to raise his eyes to\\nher face, \"Admired Lenina,\" he went on, \"indeed the top of admiration, worth\\nwhat\\'s dearest in the world.\" She smiled at him with a luscious tenderness.\\n\"Oh, you so perfect\" (she was leaning towards him with parted lips), \"so\\nperfect and so peerless are created\" (nearer and nearer) \"of every creature\\'s\\nbest.\" Still nearer. The Savage suddenly scrambled to his feet. \"That\\'s why,\"\\nhe said speaking with averted face, \"I wanted to do something first … I\\nmean, to show I was worthy of you. Not that I could ever really be that. But\\nat any rate to show I wasn\\'t absolutely un-worthy. I wanted to do\\nsomething.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why should you think it necessary …\" Lenina began, but left the sentence\\nunfinished. There was a note of irritation in her voice. When one has leant\\nforward, nearer and nearer, with parted lips–only to find oneself, quite\\nsuddenly, as a clumsy oaf scrambles to his feet, leaning towards nothing at\\nall–well, there is a reason, even with half a gramme of soma\\ncirculating in one\\'s blood-stream, a genuine reason for annoyance.\\n\\n\\n\"At Malpais,\" the Savage was incoherently mumbling, \"you had to bring her\\nthe skin of a mountain lion–I mean, when you wanted to marry some one. Or else\\na wolf.\"\\n\\n\\n\"There aren\\'t any lions in England,\" Lenina almost snapped.\\n\\n\\n\"And even if there were,\" the Savage added, with sudden contemptuous\\nresentment, \"people would kill them out of helicopters, I suppose, with poison\\ngas or something. I wouldn\\'t do that, Lenina.\" He squared his\\nshoulders, he ventured to look at her and was met with a stare of annoyed\\nincomprehension. Confused, \"I\\'ll do anything,\" he went on, more and more\\nincoherently. \"Anything you tell me. There be some sports are painful–you\\nknow. But their labour delight in them sets off. That\\'s what I feel. I mean\\nI\\'d sweep the floor if you wanted.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But we\\'ve got vacuum cleaners here,\" said Lenina in bewilderment. \"It\\nisn\\'t necessary.\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, of course it isn\\'t necessary. But some kinds of baseness are\\nnobly undergone. I\\'d like to undergo something nobly. Don\\'t you see?\"\\n\\n\\n\"But if there are vacuum cleaners …\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the point.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And Epsilon Semi-Morons to work them,\" she went on, \"well, really, why?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why? But for you, for you. Just to show that I …\"\\n\\n\\n\"And what on earth vacuum cleaners have got to do with lions …\"\\n\\n\\n\"To show how much …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Or lions with being glad to see me …\" She was getting more and\\nmore exasperated.\\n\\n\\n\"How much I love you, Lenina,\" he brought out almost desperately.\\n\\n\\nAn emblem of the inner tide of startled elation, the blood rushed up into\\nLenina\\'s cheeks. \"Do you mean it, John?\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I hadn\\'t meant to say so,\" cried the Savage, clasping his hands in a\\nkind of agony. \"Not until … Listen, Lenina; in Malpais people get married.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Get what?\" The irritation had begun to creep back into her voice. What\\nwas he talking about now?\\n\\n\\n\"For always. They make a promise to live together for always.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What a horrible idea!\" Lenina was genuinely shocked.\\n\\n\\n\"Outliving beauty\\'s outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than\\nblood decays.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s like that in Shakespeare too. \\'If thou cost break her virgin knot\\nbefore all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite …\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\"For Ford\\'s sake, John, talk sense. I can\\'t understand a word you say.\\nFirst it\\'s vacuum cleaners; then it\\'s knots. You\\'re driving me crazy.\" She\\njumped up and, as though afraid that he might run away from her physically, as\\nwell as with his mind, caught him by the wrist. \"Answer me this question: do\\nyou really like me, or don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s silence; then, in a very low voice, \"I love you more\\nthan anything in the world,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"Then why on earth didn\\'t you say so?\" she cried, and so intense was her\\nexasperation that she drove her sharp nails into the skin of his wrist.\\n\"Instead of drivelling away about knots and vacuum cleaners and lions, and\\nmaking me miserable for weeks and weeks.\"\\n\\n\\nShe released his hand and flung it angrily away from her.\\n\\n\\n\"If I didn\\'t like you so much,\" she said, \"I\\'d be furious with you.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd suddenly her arms were round his neck; he felt her lips soft against\\nhis own. So deliciously soft, so warm and electric that inevitably he found\\nhimself thinking of the embraces in Three Weeks in a Helicopter. Ooh!\\nooh! the stereoscopic blonde and anh! the more than real blackamoor. Horror,\\nhorror, horror … he fired to disengage himself; but Lenina tightened her\\nembrace.\\n\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you say so?\" she whispered, drawing back her face to look at\\nhim. Her eyes were tenderly reproachful.\\n\\n\\n\"The murkiest den, the most opportune place\" (the voice of conscience\\nthundered poetically), \"the strongest suggestion our worser genius can, shall\\nnever melt mine honour into lust. Never, never!\" he resolved.\\n\\n\\n\"You silly boy!\" she was saying. \"I wanted you so much. And if you wanted\\nme too, why didn\\'t you? …\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, Lenina …\" he began protesting; and as she immediately untwined her\\narms, as she stepped away from him, he thought, for a moment, that she had\\ntaken his unspoken hint. But when she unbuckled her white patent cartridge\\nbelt and hung it carefully over the back of a chair, he began to suspect that\\nhe had been mistaken.\\n\\n\\n\"Lenina!\" he repeated apprehensively.\\n\\n\\nShe put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull; her white\\nsailor\\'s blouse was ripped to the hem; suspicion condensed into a too, too\\nsolid certainty. \"Lenina, what are you doing?\"\\n\\n\\nZip, zip! Her answer was wordless. She stepped out of her bell-bottomed\\ntrousers. Her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. The\\nArch-Community-Songster\\'s golden T dangled at her breast.\\n\\n\\n\"For those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men\\'s eyes....\"\\nThe singing, thundering, magical words made her seem doubly dangerous, doubly\\nalluring. Soft, soft, but how piercing! boring and drilling into reason,\\ntunnelling through resolution. \"The strongest oaths are straw to the fire i\\'\\nthe blood. Be more abstemious, or else …\"\\n\\n\\nZip! The rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. A\\nwriggle of the arms, a lifting first of the right foot, then the left: the\\nzippicamiknicks were lying lifeless and as though deflated on the floor.\\n\\n\\nStill wearing her shoes and socks, and her rakishly tilted round white\\ncap, she advanced towards him. \"Darling. Darling! If only you\\'d said so\\nbefore!\" She held out her arms.\\n\\n\\nBut instead of also saying \"Darling!\" and holding out his arms, the Savage\\nretreated in terror, flapping his hands at her as though he were trying to\\nscare away some intruding and dangerous animal. Four backwards steps, and he\\nwas brought to bay against the wall.\\n\\n\\n\"Sweet!\" said Lenina and, laying her hands on his shoulders, pressed\\nherself against him. \"Put your arms round me,\" she commanded. \"Hug me till you\\ndrug me, honey.\" She too had poetry at her command, knew words that sang and\\nwere spells and beat drums. \"Kiss me\"; she closed her eyes, she let her voice\\nsink to a sleepy murmur, \"Kiss me till I\\'m in a coma. Hug me, honey, snuggly\\n…\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage caught her by the wrists, tore her hands from his shoulders,\\nthrust her roughly away at arm\\'s length.\\n\\n\\n\"Ow, you\\'re hurting me, you\\'re … oh!\" She was suddenly silent. Terror had\\nmade her forget the pain. Opening her eyes, she had seen his face–no, not\\nhis face, a ferocious stranger\\'s, pale, distorted, twitching with some\\ninsane, inexplicable fury. Aghast, \"But what is it, John?\" she whispered. He\\ndid not answer, but only stared into her face with those mad eyes. The hands\\nthat held her wrists were trembling. He breathed deeply and irregularly. Faint\\nalmost to imperceptibility, but appalling, she suddenly heard the grinding of\\nhis teeth. \"What is it?\" she almost screamed.\\n\\n\\nAnd as though awakened by her cry he caught her by the shoulders and shook\\nher. \"Whore!\" he shouted \"Whore! Impudent strumpet!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t, do-on\\'t,\" she protested in a voice made grotesquely tremulous\\nby his shaking.\\n\\n\\n\"Whore!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Plea-ease.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Damned whore!\"\\n\\n\\n\"A gra-amme is be-etter …\" she began.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage pushed her away with such force that she staggered and fell.\\n\"Go,\" he shouted, standing over her menacingly, \"get out of my sight or I\\'ll\\nkill you.\" He clenched his fists.\\n\\n\\nLenina raised her arm to cover her face. \"No, please don\\'t, John …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Hurry up. Quick!\"\\n\\n\\nOne arm still raised, and following his every movement with a terrified\\neye, she scrambled to her feet and still crouching, still covering her head,\\nmade a dash for the bathroom.\\n\\n\\nThe noise of that prodigious slap by which her departure was accelerated\\nwas like a pistol shot.\\n\\n\\n\"Ow!\" Lenina bounded forward.\\n\\n\\nSafely locked into the bathroom, she had leisure to take stock of her\\ninjuries. Standing with her back to the mirror, she twisted her head. Looking\\nover her left shoulder she could see the imprint of an open hand standing out\\ndistinct and crimson on the pearly flesh. Gingerly she rubbed the wounded\\nspot.\\n\\n\\nOutside, in the other room, the Savage was striding up and down, marching,\\nmarching to the drums and music of magical words. \"The wren goes to\\'t and the\\nsmall gilded fly does lecher in my sight.\" Maddeningly they rumbled in his\\nears. \"The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to\\'t with a more riotous\\nappetite. Down from the waist they are Centaurs, though women all above. But\\nto the girdle do the gods inherit. Beneath is all the fiend\\'s. There\\'s hell,\\nthere\\'s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit, burning scalding, stench,\\nconsumption; fie, fie, fie, pain, pain! Give me an ounce of civet, good\\napothecary, to sweeten my imagination.\"\\n\\n\\n\"John!\" ventured a small ingratiating voice from the bathroom. \"John!\"\\n\\n\\n\"O thou weed, who are so lovely fair and smell\\'st so sweet that the sense\\naches at thee. Was this most goodly book made to write \\'whore\\' upon? Heaven\\nstops the nose at it …\"\\n\\n\\nBut her perfume still hung about him, his jacket was white with the powder\\nthat had scented her velvety body. \"Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet,\\nimpudent strumpet.\" The inexorable rhythm beat itself out. \"Impudent …\"\\n\\n\\n\"John, do you think I might have my clothes?\"\\n\\n\\nHe picked up the bell-bottomed trousers, the blouse, the zippicamiknicks.\\n\\n\\n\"Open!\" he ordered, kicking the door.\\n\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t.\" The voice was frightened and defiant.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, how do you expect me to give them to you?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Push them through the ventilator over the door.\"\\n\\n\\nHe did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the room.\\n\"Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet. The devil Luxury with his fat rump and\\npotato finger …\"\\n\\n\\n\"John.\"\\n\\n\\nHe would not answer. \"Fat rump and potato finger.\"\\n\\n\\n\"John.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What is it?\" he asked gruffly.\\n\\n\"I wonder if you\\'d mind giving me my Malthusian belt.\"\\n\\n\\nLenina sat, listening to the footsteps in the other room, wondering, as\\nshe listened, how long he was likely to go tramping up and down like that;\\nwhether she would have to wait until he left the flat; or if it would be safe,\\nafter allowing his madness a reasonable time to subside, to open the bathroom\\ndoor and make a dash for it.\\n\\n\\nShe was interrupted in the midst of these uneasy speculations by the sound\\nof the telephone bell ringing in the other room. Abruptly the tramping ceased.\\nShe heard the voice of the Savage parleying with silence.\\n\\n\\n\"Hullo.\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"If I do not usurp myself, I am.\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, didn\\'t you hear me say so? Mr. Savage speaking.\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"What? Who\\'s ill? Of course it interests me.\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"But is it serious? Is she really bad? I\\'ll go at once …\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"Not in her rooms any more? Where has she been taken?\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my God! What\\'s the address?\"\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\"Three Park Lane–is that it? Three? Thanks.\"\\n\\n\\nLenina heard the click of the replaced receiver, then hurrying steps. A\\ndoor slammed. There was silence. Was he really gone?\\n\\n\\nWith an infinity of precautions she opened the door a quarter of an inch;\\npeeped through the crack; was encouraged by the view of emptiness; opened a\\nlittle further, and put her whole head out; finally tiptoed into the room;\\nstood for a few seconds with strongly beating heart, listening, listening;\\nthen darted to the front door, opened, slipped through, slammed, ran. It was\\nnot till she was in the lift and actually dropping down the well that she\\nbegan to feel herself secure.\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}',\n",

As the Savage stepped out of his taxicopter a convoy\\nof gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted away\\nacross the Park, westwards, bound for the Slough Crematorium. At the lift\\ngates the presiding porter gave him the information he required, and he\\ndropped down to Ward 81 (a Galloping Senility ward, the porter explained) on\\nthe seventeenth floor.\\n\\nIt was a large room bright with sunshine and yellow paint, and containing\\ntwenty beds, all occupied. Linda was dying in company–in company and with all\\nthe modern conveniences. The air was continuously alive with gay synthetic\\nmelodies. At the foot of every bed, confronting its moribund occupant, was a\\ntelevision box. Television was left on, a running tap, from morning till\\nnight. Every quarter of an hour the prevailing perfume of the room was\\nautomatically changed. \"We try,\" explained the nurse, who had taken charge of\\nthe Savage at the door, \"we try to create a thoroughly pleasant atmosphere\\nhere–something between a first-class hotel and a feely-palace, if you take my\\nmeaning.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Where is she?\" asked the Savage, ignoring these polite explanations.\\n\\n\\nThe nurse was offended. \"You are in a hurry,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n\"Is there any hope?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\"You mean, of her not dying?\" (He nodded.) \"No, of course there isn\\'t.\\nWhen somebody\\'s sent here, there\\'s no …\" Startled by the expression of\\ndistress on his pale face, she suddenly broke off. \"Why, whatever is the\\nmatter?\" she asked. She was not accustomed to this kind of thing in visitors.\\n(Not that there were many visitors anyhow: or any reason why there should be\\nmany visitors.) \"You\\'re not feeling ill, are you?\"\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head. \"She\\'s my mother,\" he said in a scarcely audible voice.\\n\\n\\nThe nurse glanced at him with startled, horrified eyes; then quickly\\nlooked away. From throat to temple she was all one hot blush.\\n\\n\\n\"Take me to her,\" said the Savage, making an effort to speak in an\\nordinary tone.\\n\\n\\nStill blushing, she led the way down the ward. Faces still fresh and\\nunwithered (for senility galloped so hard that it had no time to age the\\ncheeks–only the heart and brain) turned as they passed. Their progress was\\nfollowed by the blank, incurious eyes of second infancy. The Savage shuddered\\nas he looked.\\n\\n\\nLinda was lying in the last of the long row of beds, next to the wall.\\nPropped up on pillows, she was watching the Semi-finals of the South American\\nRiemann-Surface Tennis Championship, which were being played in silent and\\ndiminished reproduction on the screen of the television box at the foot of the\\nbed. Hither and thither across their square of illuminated glass the little\\nfigures noiselessly darted, like fish in an aquarium–the silent but agitated\\ninhabitants of another world.\\n\\n\\nLinda looked on, vaguely and uncomprehendingly smiling. Her pale, bloated\\nface wore an expression of imbecile happiness. Every now and then her eyelids\\nclosed, and for a few seconds she seemed to be dozing. Then with a little\\nstart she would wake up again–wake up to the aquarium antics of the Tennis\\nChampions, to the Super-Vox-Wurlitzeriana rendering of \"Hug me till you drug\\nme, honey,\" to the warm draught of verbena that came blowing through the\\nventilator above her head–would wake to these things, or rather to a dream of\\nwhich these things, transformed and embellished by the soma in her\\nblood, were the marvellous constituents, and smile once more her broken and\\ndiscoloured smile of infantile contentment.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I must go,\" said the nurse. \"I\\'ve got my batch of children coming.\\nBesides, there\\'s Number 3.\" She pointed up the ward. \"Might go off any minute\\nnow. Well, make yourself comfortable.\" She walked briskly away.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage sat down beside the bed.\\n\\n\\n\"Linda,\" he whispered, taking her hand.\\n\\n\\nAt the sound of her name, she turned. Her vague eyes brightened with\\nrecognition. She squeezed his hand, she smiled, her lips moved; then quite\\nsuddenly her head fell forward. She was asleep. He sat watching her–seeking\\nthrough the tired flesh, seeking and finding that young, bright face which had\\nstooped over his childhood in Malpais, remembering (and he closed his eyes)\\nher voice, her movements, all the events of their life together.\\n\"Streptocock-Gee to Banbury T …\" How beautiful her singing had been! And those\\nchildish rhymes, how magically strange and mysterious!\\n\\n\\nA, B, C, vitamin D:\\nThe fat\\'s in the liver, the cod\\'s in the sea.\\n\\n\\nHe felt the hot tears welling up behind his eyelids as he recalled the\\nwords and Linda\\'s voice as she repeated them. And then the reading lessons:\\nThe tot is in the pot, the cat is on the mat; and the Elementary Instructions\\nfor Beta Workers in the Embryo Store. And long evenings by the fire or, in\\nsummertime, on the roof of the little house, when she told him those stories\\nabout the Other Place, outside the Reservation: that beautiful, beautiful\\nOther Place, whose memory, as of a heaven, a paradise of goodness and\\nloveliness, he still kept whole and intact, undefiled by contact with the\\nreality of this real London, these actual civilized men and women.\\n\\n\\nA sudden noise of shrill voices made him open his eyes and, after hastily\\nbrushing away the tears, look round. What seemed an interminable stream of\\nidentical eight-year-old male twins was pouring into the room. Twin after\\ntwin, twin after twin, they came–a nightmare. Their faces, their repeated\\nface–for there was only one between the lot of them–puggishly stared, all\\nnostrils and pale goggling eyes. Their uniform was khaki. All their mouths\\nhung open. Squealing and chattering they entered. In a moment, it seemed, the\\nward was maggoty with them. They swarmed between the beds, clambered over,\\ncrawled under, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients.\\n\\n\\nLinda astonished and rather alarmed them. A group stood clustered at the\\nfoot of her bed, staring with the frightened and stupid curiosity of animals\\nsuddenly confronted by the unknown.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, look, look!\" They spoke in low, scared voices. \"Whatever is the\\nmatter with her? Why is she so fat?\"\\n\\n\\nThey had never seen a face like hers before–had never seen a face that was\\nnot youthful and taut-skinned, a body that had ceased to be slim and upright.\\nAll these moribund sexagenarians had the appearance of childish girls. At\\nforty-four, Linda seemed, by contrast, a monster of flaccid and distorted\\nsenility.\\n\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t she awful?\" came the whispered comments. \"Look at her teeth!\"\\n\\n\\nSuddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between John\\'s\\nchair and the wall, and began peering into Linda\\'s sleeping face.\\n\\n\\n\"I say …\" he began; but the sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. The\\nSavage had seized him by the collar, lifted him clear over the chair and, with\\na smart box on the ears, sent him howling away.\\n\\n\\nHis yells brought the Head Nurse hurrying to the rescue.\\n\\n\\n\"What have you been doing to him?\" she demanded fiercely. \"I won\\'t have\\nyou striking the children.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well then, keep them away from this bed.\" The Savage\\'s voice was\\ntrembling with indignation. \"What are these filthy little brats doing here at\\nall? It\\'s disgraceful!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Disgraceful? But what do you mean? They\\'re being death-conditioned. And I\\ntell you,\" she warned him truculently, \"if I have any more of your\\ninterference with their conditioning, I\\'ll send for the porters and have you\\nthrown out.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage rose to his feet and took a couple of steps towards her. His\\nmovements and the expression on his face were so menacing that the nurse fell\\nback in terror. With a great effort he checked himself and, without speaking,\\nturned away and sat down again by the bed.\\n\\n\\nReassured, but with a dignity that was a trifle shrill and uncertain,\\n\"I\\'ve warned you,\" said the nurse, \"I\\'ve warned you,\" said the nurse, \"so\\nmind.\" Still, she led the too inquisitive twins away and made them join in the\\ngame of hunt-the-zipper, which had been organized by one of her colleagues at\\nthe other end of the room.\\n\\n\\n\"Run along now and have your cup of caffeine solution, dear,\" she said to\\nthe other nurse. The exercise of authority restored her confidence, made her\\nfeel better. \"Now children!\" she called.\\n\\n\\nLinda had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked\\nvaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. Sitting beside her,\\nthe Savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before. \"A, B, C,\\nvitamin D,\" he repeated to himself, as though the words were a spell that\\nwould restore the dead past to life. But the spell was ineffective.\\nObstinately the beautiful memories refused to rise; there was only a hateful\\nresurrection of jealousies and uglinesses and miseries. Popé with the blood\\ntrickling down from his cut shoulder; and Linda hideously asleep, and the\\nflies buzzing round the spilt mescal on the floor beside the bed; and the boys\\ncalling those names as she passed. … Ah, no, no! He shut his eyes, he shook\\nhis head in strenuous denial of these memories. \"A, B, C, vitamin D …\" He\\ntried to think of those times when he sat on her knees and she put her arms\\nabout him and sang, over and over again, rocking him, rocking him to sleep.\\n\"A, B, C, vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Super-Vox-Wurlitzeriana had risen to a sobbing crescendo; and suddenly\\nthe verbena gave place, in the scent-circulating system, to an intense\\npatchouli. Linda stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds bewilderly at the\\nSemi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or twice at the newly\\nperfumed air and suddenly smiled–a smile of childish ecstasy.\\n\\n\\n\"Popé!\" she murmured, and closed her eyes. \"Oh, I do so like it, I do …\"\\nShe sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows.\\n\\n\\n\"But, Linda!\" The Savage spoke imploringly, \"Don\\'t you know me?\" He had\\ntried so hard, had done his very best; why wouldn\\'t she allow him to forget? He\\nsqueezed her limp hand almost with violence, as though he would force her to\\ncome back from this dream of ignoble pleasures, from these base and hateful\\nmemories–back into the present, back into reality: the appalling present, the\\nawful reality–but sublime, but significant, but desperately important\\nprecisely because of the imminence of that which made them so fearful. \"Don\\'t\\nyou know me, Linda?\"\\n\\n\\nHe felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. The tears started into\\nhis eyes. He bent over her and kissed her.\\n\\n\\nHer lips moved. \"Popé!\" she whispered again, and it was as though he had\\nhad a pailful of ordure thrown in his face.\\n\\n\\nAnger suddenly boiled up in him. Balked for the second time, the passion\\nof his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a passion of\\nagonized rage.\\n\\n\\n\"But I\\'m John!\" he shouted. \"I\\'m John!\" And in his furious misery he\\nactually caught her by the shoulder and shook her.\\n\\n\\nLinda\\'s eyes fluttered open; she saw him, knew him–\"John!\"–but situated\\nthe real face, the real and violent hands, in an imaginary world–among the\\ninward and private equivalents of patchouli and the Super-Wurlitzer, among the\\ntransfigured memories and the strangely transposed sensations that constituted\\nthe universe of her dream. She knew him for John, her son, but fancied him an\\nintruder into that paradisal Malpais where she had been spending her\\nsoma-holiday with Popé. He was angry because she liked Popé, he was\\nshaking her because Popé was there in the bed–as though there were something\\nwrong, as though all civilized people didn\\'t do the same. \"Every one belongs\\nto every …\" Her voice suddenly died into an almost inaudible breathless\\ncroaking. Her mouth fell open: she made a desperate effort to fill her lungs\\nwith air. But it was as though she had forgotten how to breathe. She tried to\\ncry out–but no sound came; only the terror of her staring eyes revealed what\\nshe was suffering. Her hands went to her throat, then clawed at the air–the\\nair she could no longer breathe, the air that, for her, had ceased to exist.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage was on his feet, bent over her. \"What is it, Linda? What is\\nit?\" His voice was imploring; it was as though he were begging to be\\nreassured.\\n\\n\\nThe look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror–with terror\\nand, it seemed to him, reproach.\\n\\n\\nShe tried to raise herself in bed, but fell back on to the pillows. Her\\nface was horribly distorted, her lips blue.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage turned and ran up the ward.\\n\\n\\n\"Quick, quick!\" he shouted. \"Quick!\"\\n\\n\\nStanding in the centre of a ring of zipper-hunting twins, the Head Nurse\\nlooked round. The first moment\\'s astonishment gave place almost instantly to\\ndisapproval. \"Don\\'t shout! Think of the little ones,\" she said, frowning. \"You\\nmight decondition … But what are you doing?\" He had broken through the ring.\\n\"Be careful!\" A child was yelling.\\n\\n\\n\"Quick, quick!\" He caught her by the sleeve, dragged her after him.\\n\"Quick! Something\\'s happened. I\\'ve killed her.\"\\n\\n\\nBy the time they were back at the end of the ward Linda was dead.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage stood for a moment in frozen silence, then fell on his knees\\nbeside the bed and, covering his face with his hands, sobbed uncontrollably.\\n\\n\\nThe nurse stood irresolute, looking now at the kneeling figure by the bed\\n(the scandalous exhibition!) and now (poor children!) at the twins who had\\nstopped their hunting of the zipper and were staring from the other end of the\\nward, staring with all their eyes and nostrils at the shocking scene that was\\nbeing enacted round Bed 20. Should she speak to him? try to bring him back to\\na sense of decency? remind him of where he was? of what fatal mischief he\\nmight do to these poor innocents? Undoing all their wholesome\\ndeath-conditioning with this disgusting outcry–as though death were something\\nterrible, as though any one mattered as much as all that! It might give them\\nthe most disastrous ideas about the subject, might upset them into reacting in\\nthe entirely wrong, the utterly anti-social way.\\n\\n\\nShe stepped forward, she touched him on the shoulder. \"Can\\'t you behave?\"\\nshe said in a low, angry voice. But, looking around, she saw that half a dozen\\ntwins were already on their feet and advancing down the ward. The circle was\\ndisintegrating. In another moment … No, the risk was too great; the whole\\nGroup might be put back six or seven months in its conditioning. She hurried\\nback towards her menaced charges.\\n\\n\\n\"Now, who wants a chocolate éclair?\" she asked in a loud, cheerful tone.\\n\\n\\n\"Me!\" yelled the entire Bokanovsky Group in chorus. Bed 20 was completely\\nforgotten.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, God, God, God …\" the Savage kept repeating to himself. In the chaos\\nof grief and remorse that filled his mind it was the one articulate word.\\n\"God!\" he whispered it aloud. \"God …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Whatever is he saying?\" said a voice, very near, distinct and\\nshrill through the warblings of the Super-Wurlitzer.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage violently started and, uncovering his face, looked round. Five\\nkhaki twins, each with the stump of a long éclair in his right hand, and their\\nidentical faces variously smeared with liquid chocolate, were standing in a\\nrow, puggily goggling at him.\\n\\n\\nThey met his eyes and simultaneously grinned. One of them pointed with his\\néclair butt.\\n\\n\\n\"Is she dead?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage stared at them for a moment in silence. Then in silence he rose\\nto his feet, in silence slowly walked towards the door.\\n\\n\\n\"Is she dead?\" repeated the inquisitive twin trotting at his side.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage looked down at him and still without speaking pushed him away.\\nThe twin fell on the floor and at once began to howl. The Savage did not even\\nlook round.\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

At six, when their working day was\\nover, the two Groups assembled in the vestibule of the Hospital and were\\nserved by the Deputy Sub-Bursar with their soma ration.\\n\\nFrom the lift the Savage stepped out into the midst of them. But his mind\\nwas elsewhere–with death, with his grief, and his remorse; mechanicaly,\\nwithout consciousness of what he was doing, he began to shoulder his way\\nthrough the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\"Who are you pushing? Where do you think you\\'re going?\"\\n\\n\\nHigh, low, from a multitude of separate throats, only two voices squeaked\\nor growled. Repeated indefinitely, as though by a train of mirrors, two faces,\\none a hairless and freckled moon haloed in orange, the other a thin, beaked\\nbird-mask, stubbly with two days\\' beard, turned angrily towards him. Their\\nwords and, in his ribs, the sharp nudging of elbows, broke through his\\nunawareness. He woke once more to external reality, looked round him, knew\\nwhat he saw–knew it, with a sinking sense of horror and disgust, for the\\nrecurrent delirium of his days and nights, the nightmare of swarming\\nindistinguishable sameness. Twins, twins. … Like maggots they had swarmed\\ndefilingly over the mystery of Linda\\'s death. Maggots again, but larger, full\\ngrown, they now crawled across his grief and his repentance. He halted and,\\nwith bewildered and horrified eyes, stared round him at the khaki mob, in the\\nmidst of which, overtopping it by a full head, he stood. \"How many goodly\\ncreatures are there here!\" The singing words mocked him derisively. \"How\\nbeauteous mankind is! O brave new world …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Soma distribution!\" shouted a loud voice. \"In good order, please.\\nHurry up there.\"\\n\\n\\nA door had been opened, a table and chair carried into the vestibule. The\\nvoice was that of a jaunty young Alpha, who had entered carrying a black iron\\ncash-box. A murmur of satisfaction went up from the expectant twins. They\\nforgot all about the Savage. Their attention was now focused on the black\\ncash-box, which the young man had placed on the table, and was now in process\\nof unlocking. The lid was lifted.\\n\\n\\n\"Oo-oh!\" said all the hundred and sixty-two simultaneously, as though they\\nwere looking at fireworks.\\n\\n\\nThe young man took out a handful of tiny pill-boxes. \"Now,\" he said\\nperemptorily, \"step forward, please. One at a time, and no shoving.\"\\n\\n\\nOne at a time, with no shoving, the twins stepped forward. First two\\nmales, then a female, then another male, then three females, then …\\n\\n\\nThe Savage stood looking on. \"O brave new world, O brave new world …\" In\\nhis mind the singing words seemed to change their tone. They had mocked him\\nthrough his misery and remorse, mocked him with how hideous a note of cynical\\nderision! Fiendishly laughing, they had insisted on the low squalor, the\\nnauseous ugliness of the nightmare. Now, suddenly, they trumpeted a call to\\narms. \"O brave new world!\" Miranda was proclaiming the possibility of\\nloveliness, the possibility of transforming even the nightmare into something\\nfine and noble. \"O brave new world!\" It was a challenge, a command.\\n\\n\\n\"No shoving there now!\" shouted the Deputy Sub-Bursar in a fury. He\\nslammed down he lid of his cash-box. \"I shall stop the distribution unless I\\nhave good behaviour.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Deltas muttered, jostled one another a little, and then were still.\\nThe threat had been effective. Deprivation of soma–appalling thought!\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s better,\" said the young man, and reopened his cash-box.\\n\\n\\nLinda had been a slave, Linda had died; others should live in freedom, and\\nthe world be made beautiful. A reparation, a duty. And suddenly it was\\nluminously clear to the Savage what he must do; it was as though a shutter had\\nbeen opened, a curtain drawn back.\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" said the Deputy Sub-Bursar.\\n\\n\\nAnother khaki female stepped forward.\\n\\n\\n\"Stop!\" called the Savage in a loud and ringing voice. \"Stop!\"\\n\\n\\nHe pushed his way to the table; the Deltas stared at him with\\nastonishment.\\n\\n\\n\"Ford!\" said the Deputy Sub-Bursar, below his breath. \"It\\'s the Savage.\"\\nHe felt scared.\\n\\n\\n\"Listen, I beg of you,\" cried the Savage earnestly. \"Lend me your ears …\"\\nHe had never spoken in public before, and found it very difficult to express\\nwhat he wanted to say. \"Don\\'t take that horrible stuff. It\\'s poison, it\\'s\\npoison.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I say, Mr. Savage,\" said the Deputy Sub-Bursar, smiling propitiatingly.\\n\"Would you mind letting me …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Poison to soul as well as body.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but let me get on with my distribution, won\\'t you? There\\'s a good\\nfellow.\" With the cautious tenderness of one who strokes a notoriously vicious\\nanimal, he patted the Savage\\'s arm. \"Just let me …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Never!\" cried the Savage.\\n\\n\\n\"But look here, old man …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Throw it all away, that horrible poison.\"\\n\\n\\nThe words \"Throw it all away\" pierced through the enfolding layers of\\nincomprehension to the quick of the Delta\\'s consciousness. An angry murmur\\nwent up from the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\"I come to bring you freedom,\" said the Savage, turning back towards the\\ntwins. \"I come …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Deputy Sub-Bursar heard no more; he had slipped out of the vestibule\\nand was looking up a number in the telephone book.\\n\\n\\n\"Not in his own rooms,\" Bernard summed up. \"Not in mine, not in yours. Not\\nat the Aphroditaum; not at the Centre or the College. Where can he have got\\nto?\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz shrugged his shoulders. They had come back from their work\\nexpecting to find the Savage waiting for them at one or other of the usual\\nmeeting-places, and there was no sign of the fellow. Which was annoying, as\\nthey had meant to nip across to Biarritz in Helmholtz\\'s four-seater\\nsporticopter. They\\'d be late for dinner if he didn\\'t come soon.\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll give him five more minutes,\" said Helmholtz. \"If he doesn\\'t turn up\\nby then, we\\'ll …\"\\n\\n\\nThe ringing of the telephone bell interrupted him. He picked up the\\nreceiver. \"Hullo. Speaking.\" Then, after a long interval of listening, \"Ford\\nin Flivver!\" he swore. \"I\\'ll come at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What is it?\" Bernard asked.\\n\\n\\n\"A fellow I know at the Park Lane Hospital,\" said Helmholtz. \"The Savage\\nis there. Seems to have gone mad. Anyhow, it\\'s urgent. Will you come with me?\"\\n\\n\\nTogether they hurried along the corridor to the lifts.\\n\\n\\n\"But do you like being slaves?\" the Savage was saying as they entered the\\nHospital. His face was flushed, his eyes bright with ardour and indignation.\\n\"Do you like being babies? Yes, babies. Mewling and puking,\" he added,\\nexasperated by their bestial stupidity into throwing insults at those he had\\ncome to save. The insults bounced off their carapace of thick stupidity; they\\nstared at him with a blank expression of dull and sullen resentment in their\\neyes. \"Yes, puking!\" he fairly shouted. Grief and remorse, compassion and\\nduty–all were forgotten now and, as it were, absorbed into an intense\\noverpowering hatred of these less than human monsters. \"Don\\'t you want to be\\nfree and men? Don\\'t you even understand what manhood and freedom are?\" Rage\\nwas making him fluent; the words came easily, in a rush. \"Don\\'t you?\" he\\nrepeated, but got no answer to his question. \"Very well then,\" he went on\\ngrimly. \"I\\'ll teach you; I\\'ll make you be free whether you want to or\\nnot.\" And pushing open a window that looked on to the inner court of the\\nHospital, he began to throw the little pill-boxes of soma tablets in\\nhandfuls out into the area.\\n\\n\\nFor a moment the khaki mob was silent, petrified, at the spectacle of this\\nwanton sacrilege, with amazement and horror.\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s mad,\" whispered Bernard, staring with wide open eyes. \"They\\'ll kill\\nhim. They\\'ll …\" A great shout suddenly went up from the mob; a wave of\\nmovement drove it menacingly towards the Savage. \"Ford help him!\" said\\nBernard, and averted his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\"Ford helps those who help themselves.\" And with a laugh, actually a laugh\\nof exultation, Helmholtz Watson pushed his way through the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\"Free, free!\" the Savage shouted, and with one hand continued to throw the\\nsoma into the area while, with the other, he punched the\\nindistinguishable faces of his assailants. \"Free!\" And suddenly there was\\nHelmholtz at his side–\"Good old Helmholtz!\"–also punching–\"Men at last!\"–and\\nin the interval also throwing the poison out by handfuls through the open\\nwindow. \"Yes, men! men!\" and there was no more poison left. He picked up the\\ncash-box and showed them its black emptiness. \"You\\'re free!\"\\n\\n\\nHowling, the Deltas charged with a redoubled fury.\\n\\n\\nHesitant on the fringes of the battle. \"They\\'re done for,\" said Bernard\\nand, urged by a sudden impulse, ran forward to help them; then thought better\\nof it and halted; then, ashamed, stepped forward again; then again thought\\nbetter of it, and was standing in an agony of humiliated indecision–thinking\\nthat they might be killed if he didn\\'t help them, and that he\\nmight be killed if he did–when (Ford be praised!), goggle-eyed and\\nswine-snouted in their gas-masks, in ran the police.\\n\\n\\nBernard dashed to meet them. He waved his arms; and it was action, he was\\ndoing something. He shouted \"Help!\" several times, more and more loudly so as\\nto give himself the illusion of helping. \"Help! Help! HELP!\"\\n\\n\\nThe policemen pushed him out of the way and got on with their work. Three\\nmen with spraying machines buckled to their shoulders pumped thick clouds of\\nsoma vapour into the air. Two more were busy round the portable\\nSynthetic Music Box. Carrying water pistols charged with a powerful\\nanæsthetic, four others had pushed their way into the crowd and were\\nmethodically laying out, squirt by squirt, the more ferocious of the fighters.\\n\\n\\n\"Quick, quick!\" yelled Bernard. \"They\\'ll be killed if you don\\'t hurry.\\nThey\\'ll … Oh!\" Annoyed by his chatter, one of the policemen had given him a\\nshot from his water pistol. Bernard stood for a second or two wambling\\nunsteadily on legs that seemed to have lost their bones, their tendons, their\\nmuscles, to have become mere sticks of jelly, and at last not even\\njelly-water: he tumbled in a heap on the floor.\\n\\n\\nSuddenly, from out of the Synthetic Music Box a Voice began to speak. The\\nVoice of Reason, the Voice of Good Feeling. The sound-track roll was unwinding\\nitself in Synthetic Anti-Riot Speech Number Two (Medium Strength). Straight\\nfrom the depths of a non-existent heart, \"My friends, my friends!\" said the\\nVoice so pathetically, with a note of such infinitely tender reproach that,\\nbehind their gas masks, even the policemen\\'s eyes were momentarily dimmed with\\ntears, \"what is the meaning of this? Why aren\\'t you all being happy and good\\ntogether? Happy and good,\" the Voice repeated. \"At peace, at peace.\" It\\ntrembled, sank into a whisper and momentarily expired. \"Oh, I do want you to\\nbe happy,\" it began, with a yearning earnestness. \"I do so want you to be\\ngood! Please, please be good and …\"\\n\\n\\nTwo minutes later the Voice and the soma vapour had produced their\\neffect. In tears, the Deltas were kissing and hugging one another–half a dozen\\ntwins at a time in a comprehensive embrace. Even Helmholtz and the Savage were\\nalmost crying. A fresh supply of pill-boxes was brought in from the Bursary; a\\nnew distribution was hastily made and, to the sound of the Voice\\'s richly\\naffectionate, baritone valedictions, the twins dispersed, blubbering as though\\ntheir hearts would break. \"Good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, Ford keep\\nyou! Good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, Ford keep you. Good-bye my\\ndearest, dearest …\"\\n\\n\\nWhen the last of the Deltas had gone the policeman switched off the\\ncurrent. The angelic Voice fell silent.\\n\\n\\n\"Will you come quietly?\" asked the Sergeant, \"or must we anæsthetize?\" He\\npointed his water pistol menacingly.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we\\'ll come quietly,\" the Savage answered, dabbing alternately a cut\\nlip, a scratched neck, and a bitten left hand.\\n\\n\\nStill keeping his handkerchief to his bleeding nose Helmholtz nodded in\\nconfirmation.\\n\\n\\nAwake and having recovered the use of his legs, Bernard had chosen this\\nmoment to move as inconspicuously as he could towards the door.\\n\\n\\n\"Hi, you there,\" called the Sergeant, and a swine-masked policeman hurried\\nacross the room and laid a hand on the young man\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\\nBernard turned with an expression of indignant innocence. Escaping? He\\nhadn\\'t dreamed of such a thing. \"Though what on earth you want me for,\" he\\nsaid to the Sergeant, \"I really can\\'t imagine.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re a friend of the prisoner\\'s, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well …\" said Bernard, and hesitated. No, he really couldn\\'t deny it. \"Why\\nshouldn\\'t I be?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\"Come on then,\" said the Sergeant, and led the way towards the door and\\nthe waiting police car.\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

But\\nBernard would not be cheered; without answering, without even looking at\\nHelmholtz, he went and sat down on the most uncomfortable chair in the room,\\ncarefully chosen in the obscure hope of somehow deprecating the wrath of the\\nhigher powers.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage meanwhile wandered restlessly round the room, peering with a\\nvague superficial inquisitiveness at the books in the shelves, at the\\nsound-track rolls and reading machine bobbins in their numbered pigeon-holes.\\nOn the table under the window lay a massive volume bound in limp black\\nleather-surrogate, and stamped with large golden T\\'s. He picked it up and\\nopened it. MY LIFE AND WORK, BY OUR FORD. The book had been published at\\nDetroit by the Society for the Propagation of Fordian Knowledge. Idly he\\nturned the pages, read a sentence here, a paragraph there, and had just come\\nto the conclusion that the book didn\\'t interest him, when the door opened, and\\nthe Resident World Controller for Western Europe walked briskly into the room.\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond shook hands with all three of them; but it was to the Savage\\nthat he addressed himself. \"So you don\\'t much like civilization, Mr. Savage,\"\\nhe said.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage looked at him. He had been prepared to lie, to bluster, to\\nremain sullenly unresponsive; but, reassured by the good-humoured intelligence\\nof the Controller\\'s face, he decided to tell the truth, straightforwardly.\\n\"No.\" He shook his head.\\n\\n\\nBernard started and looked horrified. What would the Controller think? To\\nbe labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn\\'t like\\ncivilization–said it openly and, of all people, to the Controller–it was\\nterrible. \"But, John,\" he began. A look from Mustapha Mond reduced him to an\\nabject silence.\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" the Savage went on to admit, \"there are some very nice\\nthings. All that music in the air, for instance …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears and\\nsometimes voices.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage\\'s face lit up with a sudden pleasure. \"Have you read it too?\"\\nhe asked. \"I thought nobody knew about that book here, in England.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Almost nobody. I\\'m one of the very few. It\\'s prohibited, you see. But as\\nI make the laws here, I can also break them. With impunity, Mr. Marx,\" he\\nadded, turning to Bernard. \"Which I\\'m afraid you can\\'t do.\"\\n\\n\\nBernard sank into a yet more hopeless misery.\\n\\n\\n\"But why is it prohibited?\" asked the Savage. In the excitement of meeting\\na man who had read Shakespeare he had momentarily forgotten everything else.\\n\\n\\nThe Controller shrugged his shoulders. \"Because it\\'s old; that\\'s the chief\\nreason. We haven\\'t any use for old things here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Even when they\\'re beautiful?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Particularly when they\\'re beautiful. Beauty\\'s attractive, and we don\\'t\\nwant people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But the new ones are so stupid and horrible. Those plays, where there\\'s\\nnothing but helicopters flying about and you feel the people kissing.\"\\nHe made a grimace. \"Goats and monkeys!\" Only in Othello\\'s word could he find\\nan adequate vehicle for his contempt and hatred.\\n\\n\\n\"Nice tame animals, anyhow,\" the Controller murmured parenthetically.\\n\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you let them see Othello instead?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told you; it\\'s old. Besides, they couldn\\'t understand it.\"\\n\\n\\nYes, that was true. He remembered how Helmholtz had laughed at Romeo\\nand Juliet. \"Well then,\" he said, after a pause, \"something new that\\'s\\nlike Othello, and that they could understand.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'ve all been wanting to write,\" said Helmholtz, breaking a\\nlong silence.\\n\\n\\n\"And it\\'s what you never will write,\" said the Controller. \"Because, if it\\nwere really like Othello nobody could understand it, however new it\\nmight be. And if were new, it couldn\\'t possibly be like Othello.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, why not?\" Helmholtz repeated. He too was forgetting the unpleasant\\nrealities of the situation. Green with anxiety and apprehension, only Bernard\\nremembered them; the others ignored him. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because our world is not the same as Othello\\'s world. You can\\'t make\\nflivvers without steel–and you can\\'t make tragedies without social\\ninstability. The world\\'s stable now. People are happy; they get what they\\nwant, and they never want what they can\\'t get. They\\'re well off; they\\'re safe;\\nthey\\'re never ill; they\\'re not afraid of death; they\\'re blissfully ignorant of\\npassion and old age; they\\'re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they\\'ve got\\nno wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they\\'re so\\nconditioned that they practically can\\'t help behaving as they ought to behave.\\nAnd if anything should go wrong, there\\'s soma. Which you go and chuck\\nout of the window in the name of liberty, Mr. Savage. Liberty!\" He\\nlaughed. \"Expecting Deltas to know what liberty is! And now expecting them to\\nunderstand Othello! My good boy!\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage was silent for a little. \"All the same,\" he insisted\\nobstinately, \"Othello\\'s good, Othello\\'s better than those\\nfeelies.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course it is,\" the Controller agreed. \"But that\\'s the price we have to\\npay for stability. You\\'ve got to choose between happiness and what people used\\nto call high art. We\\'ve sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the\\nscent organ instead.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But they don\\'t mean anything.\"\\n\\n\\n\"They mean themselves; they mean a lot of agreeable sensations to the\\naudience.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But they\\'re … they\\'re told by an idiot.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Controller laughed. \"You\\'re not being very polite to your friend, Mr.\\nWatson. One of our most distinguished Emotional Engineers …\"\\n\\n\\n\"But he\\'s right,\" said Helmholtz gloomily. \"Because it is idiotic. Writing\\nwhen there\\'s nothing to say …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Precisely. But that requires the most enormous ingenuity. You\\'re making\\nflivvers out of the absolute minimum of steel–works of art out of practically\\nnothing but pure sensation.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage shook his head. \"It all seems to me quite horrible.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course it does. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in\\ncomparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability\\nisn\\'t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of\\nthe glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of\\na struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt.\\nHappiness is never grand.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I suppose not,\" said the Savage after a silence. \"But need it be quite so\\nbad as those twins?\" He passed his hand over his eyes as though he were trying\\nto wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of identical midgets at\\nthe assembling tables, those queued-up twin-herds at the entrance to the\\nBrentford monorail station, those human maggots swarming round Linda\\'s bed of\\ndeath, the endlessly repeated face of his assailants. He looked at his\\nbandaged left hand and shuddered. \"Horrible!\"\\n\\n\\n\"But how useful! I see you don\\'t like our Bokanovsky Groups; but, I assure\\nyou, they\\'re the foundation on which everything else is built. They\\'re the\\ngyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its unswerving course.\"\\nThe deep voice thrillingly vibrated; the gesticulating hand implied all space\\nand the onrush of the irresistible machine. Mustapha Mond\\'s oratory was almost\\nup to synthetic standards.\\n\\n\\n\"I was wondering,\" said the Savage, \"why you had them at all–seeing that\\nyou can get whatever you want out of those bottles. Why don\\'t you make\\neverybody an Alpha Double Plus while you\\'re about it?\"\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond laughed. \"Because we have no wish to have our throats cut,\"\\nhe answered. \"We believe in happiness and stability. A society of Alphas\\ncouldn\\'t fail to be unstable and miserable. Imagine a factory staffed by\\nAlphas–that is to say by separate and unrelated individuals of good heredity\\nand conditioned so as to be capable (within limits) of making a free choice\\nand assuming responsibilities. Imagine it!\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage tried to imagine it, not very successfully.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s an absurdity. An Alpha-decanted, Alpha-conditioned man would go mad\\nif he had to do Epsilon Semi-Moron work–go mad, or start smashing things up.\\nAlphas can be completely socialized–but only on condition that you make them\\ndo Alpha work. Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for\\nthe good reason that for him they aren\\'t sacrifices; they\\'re the line of least\\nresistance. His conditioning has laid down rails along which he\\'s got to run.\\nHe can\\'t help himself; he\\'s foredoomed. Even after decanting, he\\'s still\\ninside a bottle–an invisible bottle of infantile and embryonic fixations. Each\\none of us, of course,\" the Controller meditatively continued, \"goes through\\nlife inside a bottle. But if we happen to be Alphas, our bottles are,\\nrelatively speaking, enormous. We should suffer acutely if we were confined in\\na narrower space. You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into\\nlower-caste bottles. It\\'s obvious theoretically. But it has also been proved\\nin actual practice. The result of the Cyprus experiment was convincing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What was that?\" asked the Savage.\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond smiled. \"Well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling\\nif you like. It began in A.F. 473. The Controllers had the island of Cyprus\\ncleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially\\nprepared batch of twenty-two thousand Alphas. All agricultural and industrial\\nequipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own\\naffairs. The result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. The\\nland wasn\\'t properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws\\nwere set at naught, orders disobeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of\\nlow-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the\\npeople with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where\\nthey were. Within six years they were having a first-class civil war. When\\nnineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors\\nunanimously petitioned the World Controllers to resume the government of the\\nisland. Which they did. And that was the end of the only society of Alphas\\nthat the world has ever seen.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage sighed, profoundly.\\n\\n\\n\"The optimum population,\" said Mustapha Mond, \"is modelled on the\\niceberg–eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And they\\'re happy below the water line?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Happier than above it. Happier than your friend here, for example.\" He\\npointed.\\n\\n\\n\"In spite of that awful work?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Awful? They don\\'t find it so. On the contrary, they like it. It\\'s\\nlight, it\\'s childishly simple. No strain on the mind or the muscles. Seven and\\na half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and\\ngames and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. What more can they ask for?\\nTrue,\" he added, \"they might ask for shorter hours. And of course we could\\ngive them shorter hours. Technically, it would be perfectly simple to reduce\\nall lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. But would they be any\\nthe happier for that? No, they wouldn\\'t. The experiment was tried, more than a\\ncentury and a half ago. The whole of Ireland was put on to the four-hour day.\\nWhat was the result? Unrest and a large increase in the consumption of\\nsoma; that was all. Those three and a half hours of extra leisure were\\nso far from being a source of happiness, that people felt constrained to take\\na holiday from them. The Inventions Office is stuffed with plans for\\nlabour-saving processes. Thousands of them.\" Mustapha Mond made a lavish\\ngesture. \"And why don\\'t we put them into execution? For the sake of the\\nlabourers; it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with excessive leisure.\\nIt\\'s the same with agriculture. We could synthesize every morsel of food, if\\nwe wanted to. But we don\\'t. We prefer to keep a third of the population on the\\nland. For their own sakes–because it takes longer to get food out of\\nthe land than out of a factory. Besides, we have our stability to think of. We\\ndon\\'t want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. That\\'s another\\nreason why we\\'re so chary of applying new inventions. Every discovery in pure\\nscience is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a\\npossible enemy. Yes, even science.\"\\n\\n\\nScience? The Savage frowned. He knew the word. But what it exactly\\nsignified he could not say. Shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had\\nnever mentioned science, and from Linda he had only gathered the vaguest\\nhints: science was something you made helicopters with, some thing that caused\\nyou to laugh at the Corn Dances, something that prevented you from being\\nwrinkled and losing your teeth. He made a desperate effort to take the\\nController\\'s meaning.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Mustapha Mond was saying, \"that\\'s another item in the cost of\\nstability. It isn\\'t only art that\\'s incompatible with happiness; it\\'s also\\nscience. Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and\\nmuzzled.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What?\" said Helmholtz, in astonishment. \"But we\\'re always saying that\\nscience is everything. It\\'s a hypnopædic platitude.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Three times a week between thirteen and seventeen,\" put in Bernard.\\n\\n\\n\"And all the science propaganda we do at the College …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; but what sort of science?\" asked Mustapha Mond sarcastically.\\n\"You\\'ve had no scientific training, so you can\\'t judge. I was a pretty good\\nphysicist in my time. Too good–good enough to realize that all our science is\\njust a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody\\'s allowed\\nto question, and a list of recipes that mustn\\'t be added to except by special\\npermission from the head cook. I\\'m the head cook now. But I was an inquisitive\\nyoung scullion once. I started doing a bit of cooking on my own. Unorthodox\\ncooking, illicit cooking. A bit of real science, in fact.\" He was silent.\\n\\n\\n\"What happened?\" asked Helmholtz Watson.\\n\\n\\nThe Controller sighed. \"Very nearly what\\'s going to happen to you young\\nmen. I was on the point of being sent to an island.\"\\n\\n\\nThe words galvanized Bernard into violent and unseemly activity. \"Send\\nme to an island?\" He jumped up, ran across the room, and stood\\ngesticulating in front of the Controller. \"You can\\'t send me. I haven\\'t\\ndone anything. lt was the others. I swear it was the others.\" He pointed\\naccusingly to Helmholtz and the Savage. \"Oh, please don\\'t send me to Iceland.\\nI promise I\\'ll do what I ought to do. Give me another chance. Please give me\\nanother chance.\" The tears began to flow. \"I tell you, it\\'s their fault,\" he\\nsobbed. \"And not to Iceland. Oh please, your fordship, please …\" And in a\\nparoxysm of abjection he threw himself on his knees before the Controller.\\nMustapha Mond tried to make him get up; but Bernard persisted in his\\ngrovelling; the stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. In the end the\\nController had to ring for his fourth secretary.\\n\\n\\n\"Bring three men,\" he ordered, \"and take Mr. Marx into a bedroom. Give him\\na good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave him.\"\\n\\n\\nThe fourth secretary went out and returned with three green-uniformed twin\\nfootmen. Still shouting and sobbing. Bernard was carried out.\\n\\n\\n\"One would think he was going to have his throat cut,\" said the\\nController, as the door closed. \"Whereas, if he had the smallest sense, he\\'d\\nunderstand that his punishment is really a reward. He\\'s being sent to an\\nisland. That\\'s to say, he\\'s being sent to a place where he\\'ll meet the most\\ninteresting set of men and women to be found anywhere in the world. All the\\npeople who, for one reason or another, have got too self-consciously\\nindividual to fit into community-life. All the people who aren\\'t satisfied\\nwith orthodoxy, who\\'ve got independent ideas of their own. Every one, in a\\nword, who\\'s any one. I almost envy you, Mr. Watson.\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz laughed. \"Then why aren\\'t you on an island yourself?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because, finally, I preferred this,\" the Controller answered. \"I was\\ngiven the choice: to be sent to an island, where I could have got on with my\\npure science, or to be taken on to the Controllers\\' Council with the prospect\\nof succeeding in due course to an actual Controllership. I chose this and let\\nthe science go.\" After a little silence, \"Sometimes,\" he added, \"I rather\\nregret the science. Happiness is a hard master–particularly other people\\'s\\nhappiness. A much harder master, if one isn\\'t conditioned to accept it\\nunquestioningly, than truth.\" He sighed, fell silent again, then continued in\\na brisker tone, \"Well, duty\\'s duty. One can\\'t consult one\\'s own preference.\\nI\\'m interested in truth, I like science. But truth\\'s a menace, science is a\\npublic danger. As dangerous as it\\'s been beneficent. It has given us the\\nstablest equilibrium in history. China\\'s was hopelessly insecure by\\ncomparison; even the primitive matriarchies weren\\'t steadier than we are.\\nThanks, l repeat, to science. But we can\\'t allow science to undo its own good\\nwork. That\\'s why we so carefully limit the scope of its researches–that\\'s why\\nI almost got sent to an island. We don\\'t allow it to deal with any but the\\nmost immediate problems of the moment. All other enquiries are most sedulously\\ndiscouraged. It\\'s curious,\" he went on after a little pause, \"to read what\\npeople in the time of Our Ford used to write about scientific progress. They\\nseemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely,\\nregardless of everything else. Knowledge was the highest good, truth the\\nsupreme value; all the rest was secondary and subordinate. True, ideas were\\nbeginning to change even then. Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the\\nemphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production\\ndemanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning;\\ntruth and beauty can\\'t. And, of course, whenever the masses seized political\\npower, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered.\\nStill, in spite of everytung, unrestricted scientific research was still\\npermitted. People still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they\\nwere the sovereign goods. Right up to the time of the Nine Years\\' War.\\nThat made them change their tune all right. What\\'s the point of truth\\nor beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you? That\\nwas when science first began to be controlled–after the Nine Years\\' War.\\nPeople were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. Anything for a\\nquiet life. We\\'ve gone on controlling ever since. It hasn\\'t been very good for\\ntruth, of course. But it\\'s been very good for happiness. One can\\'t have\\nsomething for nothing. Happiness has got to be paid for. You\\'re paying for it,\\nMr. Watson–paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. I\\nwas too much interested in truth; I paid too.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But you didn\\'t go to an island,\" said the Savage, breaking a long\\nsilence.\\n\\n\\nThe Controller smiled. \"That\\'s how I paid. By choosing to serve happiness.\\nOther people\\'s–not mine. It\\'s lucky,\" he added, after a pause, \"that there are\\nsuch a lot of islands in the world. I don\\'t know what we should do without\\nthem. Put you all in the lethal chamber, I suppose. By the way, Mr. Watson,\\nwould you like a tropical climate? The Marquesas, for example; or Samoa? Or\\nsomething rather more bracing?\"\\n\\n\\nHelmholtz rose from his pneumatic chair. \"I should like a thoroughly bad\\nclimate,\" he answered. \"I believe one would write better if the climate were\\nbad. If there were a lot of wind and storms, for example …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Controller nodded his approbation. \"I like your spirit, Mr. Watson. I\\nlike it very much indeed. As much as I officially disapprove of it.\" He\\nsmiled. \"What about the Falkland Islands?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I think that will do,\" Helmholtz answered. \"And now, if you don\\'t\\nmind, I\\'ll go and see how poor Bernard\\'s getting on.\"\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}',\n",

But I was forgetting; you\\nknow all about God, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well …\" The Savage hesitated. He would have liked to say something about\\nsolitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the\\nprecipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death. He would have liked\\nto speak; but there were no words. Not even in Shakespeare.\\n\\n\\nThe Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and\\nwas unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the bookshelves. The\\nheavy door swung open. Rummaging in the darkness within, \"It\\'s a subject,\" he\\nsaid, \"that has always had a great interest for me.\" He pulled out a thick\\nblack volume. \"You\\'ve never read this, for example.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage took it. \"The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New\\nTestaments,\" he read aloud from the title-page.\\n\\n\\n\"Nor this.\" It was a small book and had lost its cover.\\n\\n\\n\"The Imitation of Christ.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Nor this.\" He handed out another volume.\\n\\n\\n\"The Varieties of Religious Experience. By William James.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ve got plenty more,\" Mustapha Mond continued, resuming his seat. \"A\\nwhole collection of pornographic old books. God in the safe and Ford on the\\nshelves.\" He pointed with a laugh to his avowed library–to the shelves of\\nbooks, the rack full of reading-machine bobbins and sound-track rolls.\\n\\n\\n\"But if you know about God, why don\\'t you tell them?\" asked the Savage\\nindignantly. \"Why don\\'t you give them these books about God?\"\\n\\n\\n\"For the same reason as we don\\'t give them Othello: they\\'re old;\\nthey\\'re about God hundreds of years ago. Not about God now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But God doesn\\'t change.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Men do, though.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What difference does that make?\"\\n\\n\\n\"All the difference in the world,\" said Mustapha Mond. He got up again and\\nwalked to the safe. \"There was a man called Cardinal Newman,\" he said. \"A\\ncardinal,\" he exclaimed parenthetically, \"was a kind of\\nArch-Community-Songster.\"\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I Pandulph, of fair Milan, cardinal.\\' I\\'ve read about them in\\nShakespeare.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course you have. Well, as I was saying, there was a man called\\nCardinal Newman. Ah, here\\'s the book.\" He pulled it out. \"And while I\\'m about\\nit I\\'ll take this one too. It\\'s by a man called Maine de Biran. He was a\\nphilosopher, if you know what that was.\"\\n\\n\\n\"A man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth,\"\\nsaid the Savage promptly.\\n\\n\\n\"Quite so. I\\'ll read you one of the things he did dream of in a\\nmoment. Meanwhile, listen to what this old Arch-Community-Songster said.\" He\\nopened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read. \"\\'We\\nare not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make\\nourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters. We\\nare God\\'s property. Is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? Is it any\\nhappiness or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? It may be\\nthought so by the young and prosperous. These may think it a great thing to\\nhave everything, as they suppose, their own way–to depend on no one–to have to\\nthink of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual\\nacknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the\\nwill of another. But as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that\\nindependence was not made for man–that it is an unnatural state–will do for a\\nwhile, but will not carry us on safely to the end …\\'\" Mustapha Mond paused,\\nput down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages.\\n\"Take this, for example,\" he said, and in his deep voice once more began to\\nread: \"\\'A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness,\\nof listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and,\\nfeeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion\\nthat this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which,\\nas from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old\\nage; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and\\nof what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in\\nyears. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart\\nfrom any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop\\nas we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy\\nand sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less\\ntroubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and\\ndistractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from\\nbehind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light;\\nturns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of\\nsensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that\\nphenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or\\nfrom without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something\\nthat will never play us false–a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth.\\nYes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature\\nso pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us\\nfor all our other losses.\\'\" Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his\\nchair. \"One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers\\ndidn\\'t dream about was this\" (he waved his hand), \"us, the modern world. \\'You\\ncan only be independent of God while you\\'ve got youth and prosperity;\\nindependence won\\'t take you safely to the end.\\' Well, we\\'ve now got youth and\\nprosperity right up to the end. What follows? Evidently, that we can be\\nindependent of God. \\'The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our\\nlosses.\\' But there aren\\'t any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment\\nis superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful\\ndesires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when\\nwe go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of\\nrepose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of\\nconsolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is\\nthe social order?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then you think there is no God?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, I think there quite probably is one.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then why? …\"\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond checked him. \"But he manifests himself in different ways to\\ndifferent men. In premodern times he manifested himself as the being that\\'s\\ndescribed in these books. Now …\"\\n\\n\\n\"How does he manifest himself now?\" asked the Savage.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren\\'t there at\\nall.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s your fault.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Call it the fault of civilization. God isn\\'t compatible with machinery\\nand scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make your choice.\\nOur civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness. That\\'s why I\\nhave to keep these books locked up in the safe. They\\'re smut. People would be\\nshocked it …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage interrupted him. \"But isn\\'t it natural to feel there\\'s a\\nGod?\"\\n\\n\\n\"You might as well ask if it\\'s natural to do up one\\'s trousers with\\nzippers,\" said the Controller sarcastically. \"You remind me of another of\\nthose old fellows called Bradley. He defined philosophy as the finding of bad\\nreason for what one believes by instinct. As if one believed anything by\\ninstinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe\\nthem. Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons–that\\'s\\nphilosophy. People believe in God because they\\'ve been conditioned to.\\n\\n\\n\"But all the same,\" insisted the Savage, \"it is natural to believe in God\\nwhen you\\'re alone–quite alone, in the night, thinking about death …\"\\n\\n\\n\"But people never are alone now,\" said Mustapha Mond. \"We make them hate\\nsolitude; and we arrange their lives so that it\\'s almost impossible for them\\never to have it.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage nodded gloomily. At Malpais he had suffered because they had\\nshut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo, in civilized London\\nhe was suffering because he could never escape from those communal activities,\\nnever be quietly alone.\\n\\n\\n\"Do you remember that bit in King Lear?\" said the Savage at last.\\n\"\\'The gods are just and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us;\\nthe dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes,\\' and Edmund\\nanswers–you remember, he\\'s wounded, he\\'s dying–\\'Thou hast spoken right; \\'tis\\ntrue. The wheel has come full circle; I am here.\\' What about that now? Doesn\\'t\\nthere seem to be a God managing things, punishing, rewarding?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, does there?\" questioned the Controller in his turn. \"You can\\nindulge in any number of pleasant vices with a freemartin and run no risks of\\nhaving your eyes put out by your son\\'s mistress. \\'The wheel has come full\\ncircle; I am here.\\' But where would Edmund be nowadays? Sitting in a pneumatic\\nchair, with his arm round a girl\\'s waist, sucking away at his sex-hormone\\nchewing-gum and looking at the feelies. The gods are just. No doubt. But their\\ncode of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize\\nsociety; Providence takes its cue from men.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" asked the Savage. \"Are you quite sure that the Edmund in\\nthat pneumatic chair hasn\\'t been just as heavily punished as the Edmund who\\'s\\nwounded and bleeding to death? The gods are just. Haven\\'t they used his\\npleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Degrade him from what position? As a happy, hard-working, goods-consuming\\ncitizen he\\'s perfect. Of course, if you choose some other standard than ours,\\nthen perhaps you might say he was degraded. But you\\'ve got to stick to one set\\nof postulates. You can\\'t play Electro-magnetic Golf according to the rules of\\nCentrifugal Bumble-puppy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But value dwells not in particular will,\" said the Savage. \"It holds his\\nestimate and dignity as well wherein \\'tis precious of itself as in the\\nprizer.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" protested Mustapha Mond, \"that\\'s going rather far, isn\\'t\\nit?\"\\n\\n\\n\"If you allowed yourselves to think of God, you wouldn\\'t allow yourselves\\nto be degraded by pleasant vices. You\\'d have a reason for bearing things\\npatiently, for doing things with courage. I\\'ve seen it with the Indians.\"\\n\\n\\n\"l\\'m sure you have,\" said Mustapha Mond. \"But then we aren\\'t Indians.\\nThere isn\\'t any need for a civilized man to bear anything that\\'s seriously\\nunpleasant. And as for doing things–Ford forbid that he should get the idea\\ninto his head. It would upset the whole social order if men started doing\\nthings on their own.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What about self-denial, then? If you had a God, you\\'d have a reason for\\nself-denial.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But industrial civilization is only possible when there\\'s no self-denial.\\nSelf-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics.\\nOtherwise the wheels stop turning.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d have a reason for chastity!\" said the Savage, blushing a little as\\nhe spoke the words.\\n\\n\\n\"But chastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and\\nneurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization.\\nYou can\\'t have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But God\\'s the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. If you had\\na God …\"\\n\\n\\n\"My dear young friend,\" said Mustapha Mond, \"civilization has absolutely\\nno need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political\\ninefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any\\nopportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly\\nunstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars, where there are\\ndivided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of\\nlove to be fought for or defended–there, obviously, nobility and heroism have\\nsome sense. But there aren\\'t any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to\\nprevent you from loving any one too much. There\\'s no such thing as a divided\\nallegiance; you\\'re so conditioned that you can\\'t help doing what you ought to\\ndo. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the\\nnatural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren\\'t any\\ntemptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything\\nunpleasant should somehow happen, why, there\\'s always soma to give you\\na holiday from the facts. And there\\'s always soma to calm your anger,\\nto reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In\\nthe past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and\\nafter years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme\\ntablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at\\nleast half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears–that\\'s\\nwhat soma is.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But the tears are necessary. Don\\'t you remember what Othello said? \\'If\\nafter every tempest came such calms, may the winds blow till they have wakened\\ndeath.\\' There\\'s a story one of the old Indians used to tell us, about the Girl\\nof Mátaski. The young men who wanted to marry her had to do a morning\\'s hoeing\\nin her garden. It seemed easy; but there were flies and mosquitoes, magic\\nones. Most of the young men simply couldn\\'t stand the biting and stinging. But\\nthe one that could–he got the girl.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Charming! But in civilized countries,\" said the Controller, \"you can have\\ngirls without hoeing for them, and there aren\\'t any flies or mosquitoes to\\nsting you. We got rid of them all centuries ago.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage nodded, frowning. \"You got rid of them. Yes, that\\'s just like\\nyou. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with\\nit. Whether \\'tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of\\noutrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing\\nend them … But you don\\'t do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just\\nabolish the slings and arrows. It\\'s too easy.\"\\n\\n\\nHe was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. In her room on the\\nthirty-seventh floor, Linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and\\nperfumed caresses–floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the prison\\nof her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. And Tomakin,\\nex-Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning, Tomakin was still on holiday–on\\nholiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he could not hear those\\nwords, that derisive laughter, could not see that hideous face, feel those\\nmoist and flabby arms round his neck, in a beautiful world …\\n\\n\\n\"What you need,\" the Savage went on, \"is something with tears for a\\nchange. Nothing costs enough here.\"\\n\\n\\n(\"Twelve and a half million dollars,\" Henry Foster had protested when the\\nSavage told him that. \"Twelve and a half million–that\\'s what the new\\nConditioning Centre cost. Not a cent less.\")\\n\\n\\n\"Exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and danger\\ndare, even for an eggshell. Isn\\'t there something in that?\" he asked, looking\\nup at Mustapha Mond. \"Quite apart from God–though of course God would be a\\nreason for it. Isn\\'t there something in living dangerously?\"\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s a great deal in it,\" the Controller replied. \"Men and women must\\nhave their adrenals stimulated from time to time.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What?\" questioned the Savage, uncomprehending.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of the conditions of perfect health. That\\'s why we\\'ve made the\\nV.P.S. treatments compulsory.\"\\n\\n\\n\"V.P.S.?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Violent Passion Surrogate. Regularly once a month. We flood the whole\\nsystem with adrenin. It\\'s the complete physiological equivalent of fear and\\nrage. All the tonic effects of murdering Desdemona and being murdered by\\nOthello, without any of the inconveniences.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I like the inconveniences.\"\\n\\n\\n\"We don\\'t,\" said the Controller. \"We prefer to do things comfortably.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger,\\nI want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.\"\\n\\n\\n\"In fact,\" said Mustapha Mond, \"you\\'re claiming the right to be unhappy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"All right then,\" said the Savage defiantly, \"I\\'m claiming the right to be\\nunhappy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to\\nhave syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be\\nlousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen\\nto-morrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable\\npains of every kind.\" There was a long silence.\\n\\n\\n\"I claim them all,\" said the Savage at last.\\n\\n\\nMustapha Mond shrugged his shoulders. \"You\\'re welcome,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNWAldous Huxley: Brave New World Revisited\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n',\n",

The unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; there was\\nsilence. Then, with a click the bathroom door opened and, very pale, the\\nSavage emerged.\\n\\n\\n\"I say,\" Helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, \"you do look ill, John!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Did you eat something that didn\\'t agree with you?\" asked Bernard.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage nodded. \"I ate civilization.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\\n\"It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,\" he added, in a lower tone, \"I\\nate my own wickedness.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but what exactly? … I mean, just now you were …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Now I am purified,\" said the Savage. \"I drank some mustard and warm\\nwater.\"\\n\\n\\nThe others stared at him in astonishment. \"Do you mean to say that you\\nwere doing it on purpose?\" asked Bernard.\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s how the Indians always purify themselves.\" He sat down and,\\nsighing, passed his hand across his forehead. \"I shall rest for a few\\nminutes,\" he said. \"I\\'m rather tired.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not surprised,\" said Helmholtz. After a silence, \"We\\'ve come to\\nsay good-bye,\" he went on in another tone. \"We\\'re off to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'re off to-morrow,\" said Bernard on whose face the Savage remarked\\na new expression of determined resignation. \"And by the way, John,\" he\\ncontinued, leaning forward in his chair and laying a hand on the Savage\\'s\\nknee, \"I want to say how sorry I am about everything that happened yesterday.\"\\nHe blushed. \"How ashamed,\" he went on, in spite of the unsteadiness of his\\nvoice, \"how really …\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage cut him short and, taking his hand, affectionately pressed it.\\n\\n\\n\"Helmholtz was wonderful to me,\" Bernard resumed, after a little pause.\\n\"If it hadn\\'t been for him, I should …\"\\n\\n\\n\"Now, now,\" Helmholtz protested.\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence. In spite of their sadness–because of it, even; for\\ntheir sadness was the symptom of their love for one another–the three young\\nmen were happy.\\n\\n\\n\"I went to see the Controller this morning,\" said the Savage at last.\\n\\n\\n\"What for?\"\\n\\n\\n\"To ask if I mightn\\'t go to the islands with you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And what did he say?\" asked Helmholtz eagerly.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage shook his head. \"He wouldn\\'t let me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"He said he wanted to go on with the experiment. But I\\'m damned,\" the\\nSavage added, with sudden fury, \"I\\'m damned if I\\'ll go on being experimented\\nwith. Not for all the Controllers in the world. l shall go away to-morrow\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But where?\" the others asked in unison.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage shrugged his shoulders. \"Anywhere. I don\\'t care. So long as I\\ncan be alone.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom Guildford the down-line followed the Wey valley to Godalming, then,\\nover Milford and Witley, proceeded to Haslemere and on through Petersfield\\ntowards Portsmouth. Roughly parallel to it, the upline passed over Worplesden,\\nTongham, Puttenham, Elstead and Grayshott. Between the Hog\\'s Back and Hindhead\\nthere were points where the two lines were not more than six or seven\\nkilometres apart. The distance was too small for careless flyers–particularly\\nat night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. There had been\\naccidents. Serious ones. It had been decided to deflect the upline a few\\nkilometres to the west. Between Grayshott and Tongham four abandoned\\nair-lighthouses marked the course of the old Portsmouth-to-London road. The\\nskies above them were silent and deserted. It was over Selborne, Bordon and\\nFarnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage had chosen as his hermitage the old light-house which stood on\\nthe crest of the hill between Puttenham and Elstead. The building was of\\nferro-concrete and in excellent condition–almost too comfortable the Savage\\nhad thought when he first explored the place, almost too civilizedly\\nluxurious. He pacified his conscience by promising himself a compensatingly\\nharder self-discipline, purifications the more complete and thorough. His\\nfirst night in the hermitage was, deliberately, a sleepless one. He spent the\\nhours on his knees praying, now to that Heaven from which the guilty Claudius\\nhad begged forgiveness, now in Zuñi to Awonawilona, now to Jesus and Pookong,\\nnow to his own guardian animal, the eagle. From time to time he stretched out\\nhis arms as though he were on the Cross, and held them thus through long\\nminutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and\\nexcruciating agony; held them, in voluntary crucifixion, while he repeated,\\nthrough clenched teeth (the sweat, meanwhile, pouring down his face), \"Oh,\\nforgive me! Oh, make me pure! Oh, help me to be good!\" again and again, till\\nhe was on the point of fainting from the pain.\\n\\n\\nWhen morning came, he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the\\nlighthouse; yet, even though there still was glass in most of the windows,\\neven though the view from the platform was so fine. For the very reason why he\\nhad chosen the lighthouse had become almost instantly a reason for going\\nsomewhere else. He had decided to live there because the view was so\\nbeautiful, because, from his vantage point, he seemed to be looking out on to\\nthe incarnation of a divine being. But who was he to be pampered with the\\ndaily and hourly sight of loveliness? Who was he to be living in the visible\\npresence of God? All he deserved to live in was some filthy sty, some blind\\nhole in the ground. Stiff and still aching after his long night of pain, but\\nfor that very reason inwardly reassured, he climbed up to the platform of his\\ntower, he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had regained the\\nright to inhabit. On the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of\\nthe Hog\\'s Back, from behind whose eastern extremity rose the towers of the\\nseven skyscrapers which constituted Guildford. Seeing them, the Savage made a\\ngrimace; but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time; for at\\nnight they twinkled gaily with geometrical constellations, or else,\\nflood-lighted, pointed their luminous fingers (with a gesture whose\\nsignificance nobody in England but the Savage now understood) solemnly towards\\nthe plumbless mysteries of heaven.\\n\\n\\nIn the valley which separated the Hog\\'s Back from the sandy hill on which\\nthe lighthouse stood, Puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high,\\nwith silos, a poultry farm, and a small vitamin-D factory. On the other side\\nof the lighthouse, towards the South, the ground fell away in long slopes of\\nheather to a chain of ponds.\\n\\n\\nBeyond them, above the intervening woods, rose the fourteen-story tower of\\nElstead. Dim in the hazy English air, Hindhead and Selborne invited the eye\\ninto a blue romantic distance. But it was not alone the distance that had\\nattracted the Savage to his lighthouse; the near was as seductive as the far.\\nThe woods, the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse, the clumps of\\nScotch firs, the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees, their water\\nlilies, their beds of rushes–these were beautiful and, to an eye accustomed to\\nthe aridities of the American desert, astonishing. And then the solitude!\\nWhole days passed during which he never saw a human being. The lighthouse was\\nonly a quarter of an hour\\'s flight from the Charing-T Tower; but the hills of\\nMalpais were hardly more deserted than this Surrey heath. The crowds that\\ndaily left London, left it only to play Electro-magnetic Golf or Tennis.\\nPuttenham possessed no links; the nearest Riemann-surfaces were at Guildford.\\nFlowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. And so, as there was\\nno good reason for coming, nobody came. During the first days the Savage lived\\nalone and undisturbed.\\n\\n\\nOf the money which, on his first arrival, John had received for his\\npersonal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. Before leaving London\\nhe had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, nails, glue, a\\nfew tools, matches (though he intended in due course to make a fire drill),\\nsome pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, and ten kilogrammes of wheat\\nflour. \"No, not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute,\" he\\nhad insisted. \"Even though it is more nourishing.\" But when it came to\\npan-glandular biscuits and vitaminized beef-surrogate, he had not been able to\\nresist the shopman\\'s persuasion. Looking at the tins now, he bitterly\\nreproached himself for his weakness. Loathesome civilized stuff! He had made\\nup his mind that he would never eat it, even if he were starving. \"That\\'ll\\nteach them,\" he thought vindictively. It would also teach him.\\n\\n\\nHe counted his money. The little that remained would be enough, he hoped,\\nto tide him over the winter. By next spring, his garden would be producing\\nenough to make him independent of the outside world. Meanwhile, there would\\nalways be game. He had seen plenty of rabbits, and there were waterfowl on the\\nponds. He set to work at once to make a bow and arrows.\\n\\n\\nThere were ash trees near the lighthouse and, for arrow shafts, a whole\\ncopse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. He began by felling a young\\nash, cut out six feet of unbranched stem, stripped off the bark and, paring by\\nparing, shaved away the white wood, as old Mitsima had taught him, until he\\nhad a stave of his own height, stiff at the thickened centre, lively and quick\\nat the slender tips. The work gave him an intense pleasure. After those weeks\\nof idleness in London, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to\\npress a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something\\nthat demanded skill and patience.\\n\\n\\nHe had almost finished whittling the stave into shape, when he realized\\nwith a start that he was singing-singing! It was as though, stumbling\\nupon himself from the outside, he had suddenly caught himself out, taken\\nhimself flagrantly at fault. Guiltily he blushed. After all, it was not to\\nsing and enjoy himself that he had come here. It was to escape further\\ncontamination by the filth of civilized life; it was to be purified and made\\ngood; it was actively to make amends. He realized to his dismay that, absorbed\\nin the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he\\nwould constantly remember–poor Linda, and his own murderous unkindness to her,\\nand those loathsome twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death,\\ninsulting, with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but\\nthe very gods themselves. He had sworn to remember, he had sworn unceasingly\\nto make amends. And there was he, sitting happily over his bow-stave, singing,\\nactually singing. …\\n\\n\\nHe went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on\\nthe fire.\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later, three Delta-Minus landworkers from one of the\\nPuttenham Bokanovsky Groups happened to be driving to Elstead and, at the top\\nof the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing 0utside the abandoned\\nlighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted\\ncords. His back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal\\nran thin trickles of blood. The driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of\\nthe road and, with his two companions, stared open-mouthed at the\\nextraordinary spectacle. One, two three–they counted the strokes. After the\\neighth, the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood\\'s\\nedge and there be violently sick. When he had finished, he picked up the whip\\nand began hitting himself again. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve …\\n\\n\\n\"Ford!\" whispered the driver. And his twins were of the same opinion.\\n\\n\\n\"Fordey!\" they said.\\n\\n\\nThree days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the reporters\\ncame.\\n\\n\\nDried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. The\\nSavage was busy on his arrows. Thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and\\ndried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. He had made a raid one night\\non the Puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole\\narmoury. It was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of\\nthe reporters found him. Noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up\\nbehind him.\\n\\n\\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Savage,\" he said. \"I am the representative of The\\nHourly Radio.\"\\n\\n\\nStartled as though by the bite of a snake, the Savage sprang to his feet,\\nscattering arrows, feathers, glue-pot and brush in all directions.\\n\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the reporter, with genuine compunction. \"I had\\nno intention …\" He touched his hat–the aluminum stove-pipe hat in which he\\ncarried his wireless receiver and transmitter. \"Excuse my not taking it off,\"\\nhe said. \"It\\'s a bit heavy. Well, as I was saying, I am the representative of\\nThe Hourly …\"\\n\\n\\n\"What do you want?\" asked the Savage, scowling. The reporter returned his\\nmost ingratiating smile.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, of course, our readers would be profoundly interested …\" He put his\\nhead on one side, his smile became almost coquettish. \"Just a few words from\\nyou, Mr. Savage.\" And rapidly, with a series of ritual gestures, he uncoiled\\ntwo wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist; plugged\\nthem simultaneously into the sides of his aluminum hat; touched a spring on\\nthe crown–and antennæ shot up into the air; touched another spring on the peak\\nof the brim–and, like a jack-in-the-box, out jumped a microphone and hung\\nthere, quivering, six inches in front of his nose; pulled down a pair of\\nreceivers over his ears; pressed a switch on the left side of the hat-and from\\nwithin came a faint waspy buzzing; turned a knob on the right–and the buzzing\\nwas interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and cackle, by hiccoughs and sudden\\nsqueaks. \"Hullo,\" he said to the microphone, \"hullo, hullo …\" A bell suddenly\\nrang inside his hat. \"Is that you, Edzel? Primo Mellon speaking. Yes, I\\'ve got\\nhold of him. Mr. Savage will now take the microphone and say a few words.\\nWon\\'t you, Mr. Savage?\" He looked up at the Savage with another of those\\nwinning smiles of his. \"Just tell our readers why you came here. What made you\\nleave London (hold on, Edzel!) so very suddenly. And, of course, that whip.\"\\n(The Savage started. How did they know about the whip?) \"We\\'re all crazy to\\nknow about the whip. And then something about Civilization. You know the sort\\nof stuff. \\'What I think of the Civilized Girl.\\' Just a few words, a very few\\n…\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. Five words he uttered\\nand no more-five words, the same as those he had said to Bernard about the\\nArch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. \"Háni! Sons éso tse-ná!\" And\\nseizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him round (the young man\\nrevealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed and, with all the force and\\naccuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth-baller, delivered a most prodigious\\nkick.\\n\\n\\nEight minutes later, a new edition of The Hourly Radio was on sale\\nin the streets of London. \"HOURLY RADIO REPORTER HAS COCCYX KICKED BY MYSTERY\\nSAVAGE,\" ran the headlines on the front page. \"SENSATION IN SURREY.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Sensation even in London,\" thought the reporter when, on his return, he\\nread the words. And a very painful sensation, what was more. He sat down\\ngingerly to his luncheon.\\n\\n\\nUndeterred by that cautionary bruise on their colleague\\'s coccyx, four\\nother reporters, representing the New York Times, the Frankfurt\\nFour-Dimensional Continuum, The Fordian Science Monitor, and\\nThe Delta Mirror, called that afternoon at the lighthouse and met with\\nreceptions of progressively increasing violence.\\n\\n\\nFrom a safe distance and still rubbing his buttocks, \"Benighted fool!\"\\nshouted the man from The Fordian Science Monitor, \"why don\\'t you take\\nsoma?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Get away!\" The Savage shook his fist.\\n\\n\\nThe other retreated a few steps then turned round again. \"Evil\\'s an\\nunreality if you take a couple of grammes.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Kohakwa iyathtokyai!\" The tone was menacingly derisive.\\n\\n\\n\"Pain\\'s a delusion.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, is it?\" said the Savage and, picking up a thick hazel switch, strode\\nforward.\\n\\n\\nThe man from The Fordian Science Monitor made a dash for his helicopter.\\n\\n\\nAfter that the Savage was left for a time in peace. A few helicopters came\\nand hovered inquisitively round the tower. He shot an arrow into the\\nimportunately nearest of them. It pierced the aluminum floor of the cabin;\\nthere was a shrill yell, and the machine went rocketing up into the air with\\nall the acceleration that its super-charger could give it. The others, in\\nfuture, kept their distance respectfully. Ignoring their tiresome humming (he\\nlikened himself in his imagination to one of the suitors of the Maiden of\\nMátsaki, unmoved and persistent among the winged vermin), the Savage dug at\\nwhat was to be his garden. After a time the vermin evidently became bored and\\nflew away; for hours at a stretch the sky above his head was empty and, but\\nfor the larks, silent.\\n\\n\\nThe weather was breathlessly hot, there was thunder in the air. He had dug\\nall the morning and was resting, stretched out along the floor. And suddenly\\nthe thought of Lenina was a real presence, naked and tangible, saying \"Sweet!\"\\nand \"Put your arms round me!\"–in shoes and socks, perfumed. Impudent strumpet!\\nBut oh, oh, her arms round his neck, the lifting of her breasts, her mouth!\\nEternity was in our lips and eyes. Lenina … No, no, no, no! He sprang to his\\nfeet and, half naked as he was, ran out of the house. At the edge of the heath\\nstood a clump of hoary juniper bushes. He flung himself against them, he\\nembraced, not the smooth body of his desires, but an armful of green spikes.\\nSharp, with a thousand points, they pricked him. He tried to think of poor\\nLinda, breathless and dumb, with her clutching hands and the unutterable\\nterror in her eyes. Poor Linda whom he had sworn to remember. But it was still\\nthe presence of Lenina that haunted him. Lenina whom he had promised to\\nforget. Even through the stab and sting of the juniper needles, his wincing\\nflesh was aware of her, unescapably real. \"Sweet, sweet … And if you wanted me\\ntoo, why didn\\'t you …\"\\n\\n\\nThe whip was hanging on a nail by the door, ready to hand against the\\narrival of reporters. In a frenzy the Savage ran back to the house, seized it,\\nwhirled it. The knotted cords bit into his flesh.\\n\\n\\n\"Strumpet! Strumpet!\" he shouted at every blow as though it were Lenina\\n(and how frantically, without knowing it, he wished it were), white, warm,\\nscented, infamous Lenina that he was dogging thus. \"Strumpet!\" And then, in a\\nvoice of despair, \"Oh, Linda, forgive me. Forgive me, God. I\\'m bad. I\\'m\\nwicked. I\\'m … No, no, you strumpet, you strumpet!\"\\n\\n\\nFrom his carefully constructed hide in the wood three hundred metres away,\\nDarwin Bonaparte, the Feely Corporation\\'s most expert big game photographer\\nhad watched the whole proceedings. Patience and skill had been rewarded. He\\nhad spent three days sitting inside the bole of an artificial oak tree, three\\nnights crawling on his belly through the heather, hiding microphones in gorse\\nbushes, burying wires in the soft grey sand. Seventy-two hours of profound\\ndiscomfort. But now me great moment had come–the greatest, Darwin Bonaparte\\nhad time to reflect, as he moved among his instruments, the greatest since his\\ntaking of the famous all-howling stereoscopic feely of the gorillas\\' wedding.\\n\"Splendid,\" he said to himself, as the Savage started his astonishing\\nperformance. \"Splendid!\" He kept his telescopic cameras carefully aimed–glued\\nto their moving objective; clapped on a higher power to get a close-up of the\\nfrantic and distorted face (admirable!); switched over, for half a minute, to\\nslow motion (an exquisitely comical effect, he promised himself); listened in,\\nmeanwhile, to the blows, the groans, the wild and raving words that were being\\nrecorded on the sound-track at the edge of his film, tried the effect of a\\nlittle amplification (yes, that was decidedly better); was delighted to hear,\\nin a momentary lull, the shrill singing of a lark; wished the Savage would\\nturn round so that he could get a good close-up of the blood on his back–and\\nalmost instantly (what astonishing luck!) the accommodating fellow did turn\\nround, and he was able to take a perfect close-up.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, that was grand!\" he said to himself when it was all over. \"Really\\ngrand!\" He mopped his face. When they had put in the feely effects at the\\nstudio, it would be a wonderful film. Almost as good, thought Darwin\\nBonaparte, as the Sperm Whale\\'s Love-Life–and that, by Ford, was saying\\na good deal!\\n\\n\\nTwelve days later The Savage of Surrey had been released and could be\\nseen, heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in Western Europe.\\n\\n\\nThe effect of Darwin Bonaparte\\'s film was immediate and enormous. On the\\nafternoon which followed the evening of its release John\\'s rustic solitude was\\nsuddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm of helicopters.\\n\\n\\nHe was digging in his garden–digging, too, in his own mind, laboriously\\nturning up the substance of his thought. Death–and he drove in his spade once,\\nand again, and yet again. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to\\ndusty death. A convincing thunder rumbled through the words. He lifted another\\nspadeful of earth. Why had Linda died? Why had she been allowed to become\\ngradually less than human and at last … He shuddered. A good kissing carrion.\\nHe planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough\\nground. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their\\nsport. Thunder again; words that proclaimed themselves true–truer somehow than\\ntruth itself. And yet that same Gloucester had called them ever-gentle gods.\\nBesides, thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok\\'st; yet grossly\\nfear\\'st thy death which is no more. No more than sleep. Sleep. Perchance to\\ndream. His spade struck against a stone; he stooped to pick it up. For in that\\nsleep of death, what dreams? …\\n\\n\\nA humming overhead had become a roar; and suddenly he was in shadow, there\\nwas something between the sun and him. He looked up, startled, from his\\ndigging, from his thoughts; looked up in a dazzled bewilderment, his mind\\nstill wandering in that other world of truer-than-truth, still focused on the\\nimmensities of death and deity; looked up and saw, close above him, the swarm\\nof hovering machines. Like locusts they came, hung poised, descended all\\naround him on the heather. And from out of the bellies of these giant\\ngrasshoppers stepped men in white viscose-flannels, women (for the weather was\\nhot) in acetate-shantung pyjamas or velveteen shorts and sleeveless,\\nhalf-unzippered singlets–one couple from each. In a few minutes there were\\ndozens of them, standing in a wide circle round the lighthouse, staring,\\nlaughing, clicking their cameras, throwing (as to an ape) peanuts, packets of\\nsex-hormone chewing-gum, pan-glandular petite beurres. And every\\nmoment–for across the Hog\\'s Back the stream of traffic now flowed\\nunceasingly–their numbers increased. As in a nightmare, the dozens became\\nscores, the scores hundreds.\\n\\n\\nThe Savage had retreated towards cover, and now, in the posture of an\\nanimal at bay, stood with his back to the wall of the lighthouse, staring from\\nface to face in speechless horror, like a man out of his senses.\\n\\n\\nFrom this stupor he was aroused to a more immediate sense of reality by\\nthe impact on his cheek of a well-aimed packet of chewing-gum. A shock of\\nstartling pain–and he was broad awake, awake and fiercely angry.\\n\\n\\n\"Go away!\" he shouted.\\n\\n\\nThe ape had spoken; there was a burst of laughter and hand-clapping. \"Good\\nold Savage! Hurrah, hurrah!\" And through the babel he heard cries of: \"Whip,\\nwhip, the whip!\"\\n\\n\\nActing on the word\\'s suggestion, he seized the bunch of knotted cords from\\nits nail behind the door and shook it at his tormentors.\\n\\n\\nThere was a yell of ironical applause.\\n\\n\\nMenacingly he advanced towards them. A woman cried out in fear. The line\\nwavered at its most immediately threatened point, then stiffened again, stood\\nfirm. The consciousness of being in overwhelming force had given these\\nsightseers a courage which the Savage had not expected of them. Taken aback,\\nhe halted and looked round.\\n\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you leave me alone?\" There was an almost plaintive note in his\\nanger.\\n\\n\\n\"Have a few magnesium-salted almonds!\" said the man who, if the Savage\\nwere to advance, would be the first to be attacked. He held out a packet.\\n\"They\\'re really very good, you know,\" he added, with a rather nervous smile of\\npropitiation. \"And the magnesium salts will help to keep you young.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Savage ignored his offer. \"What do you want with me?\" he asked,\\nturning from one grinning face to another. \"What do you want with me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"The whip,\" answered a hundred voices confusedly. \"Do the whipping stunt.\\nLet\\'s see the whipping stunt.\"\\n\\n\\nThen, in unison and on a slow, heavy rhythm, \"We-want-the whip,\" shouted a\\ngroup at the end of the line. \"We–want–the whip.\"\\n\\n\\nOthers at once took up the cry, and the phrase was repeated,\\nparrot-fashion, again and again, with an ever-growing volume of sound, until,\\nby the seventh or eighth reiteration, no other word was being spoken.\\n\"We–want–the whip.\"\\n\\n\\nThey were all crying together; and, intoxicated by the noise, the\\nunanimity, the sense of rhythmical atonement, they might, it seemed, have gone\\non for hours-almost indefinitely. But at about the twenty-fifth repetition the\\nproceedings were startlingly interrupted. Yet another helicopter had arrived\\nfrom across the Hog\\'s Back, hung poised above the crowd, then dropped within a\\nfew yards of where the Savage was standing, in the open space between the line\\nof sightseers and the lighthouse. The roar of the air screws momentarily\\ndrowned the shouting; then, as the machine touched the ground and the engines\\nwere turned off: \"We–want–the whip; we–want–the whip,\" broke out again in the\\nsame loud, insistent monotone.\\n\\n\\nThe door of the helicopter opened, and out stepped, first a fair and\\nruddy-faced young man, then, in green velveteen shorts, white shirt, and\\njockey cap, a young woman.\\n\\n\\nAt the sight of the young woman, the Savage started, recoiled, turned\\npale.\\n\\n\\nThe young woman stood, smiling at him–an uncertain, imploring, almost\\nabject smile. The seconds passed. Her lips moved, she was saying something;\\nbut the sound of her voice was covered by the loud reiterated refrain of the\\nsightseers.\\n\\n\\n\"We–want–the whip! We–want–the whip!\"\\n\\n\\nThe young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that\\npeach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongruous\\nexpression of yearning distress. Her blue eyes seemed to grow larger,\\nbrighter; and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. Inaudibly, she spoke\\nagain; then, with a quick, impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards\\nthe Savage, stepped forward.\\n\\n\\n\"We–want–the whip! We–want …\"\\n\\n\\nAnd all of a sudden they had what they wanted.\\n\\n\\n\"Strumpet!\" The Savage had rushed at her like a madman. \"Fitchew!\" Like a\\nmadman, he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords.\\n\\n\\nTerrified, she had turned to flee, had tripped and fallen in the heather.\\n\"Henry, Henry!\" she shouted. But her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of\\nharm\\'s way behind the helicopter.\\n\\n\\nWith a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke; there was a\\nconvergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. Pain was a\\nfascinating horror.\\n\\n\\n\"Fry, lechery, fry!\" Frenzied, the Savage slashed again.\\n\\n\\nHungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the\\ntrough.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, the flesh!\" The Savage ground his teeth. This time it was on his\\nshoulders that the whip descended. \"Kill it, kill it!\"\\n\\n\\nDrawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, impelled\\nby that habit of cooperation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which\\ntheir conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime\\nthe frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the Savage struck at\\nhis own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing\\nin the heather at his feet.\\n\\n\\n\"Kill it, kill it, kill it …\" The Savage went on shouting.\\n\\n\\nThen suddenly somebody started singing \"Orgy-porgy\" and, in a moment, they\\nhad all caught up the refrain and, singing, had begun to dance. Orgy-porgy,\\nround and round and round, beating one another in six-eight time. Orgy-porgy …\\n\\n\\nIt was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight.\\nStupefied by soma, and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensuality, the\\nSavage lay sleeping in the heather. The sun was already high when he awoke. He\\nlay for a moment, blinking in owlish incomprehension at the light; then\\nsuddenly remembered–everything.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" He covered his eyes with his hand.\\n\\n\\nThat evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the Hog\\'s\\nBack was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. The description of last night\\'s\\norgy of atonement had been in all the papers.\\n\\n\\n\"Savage!\" called the first arrivals, as they alighted from their machine.\\n\"Mr. Savage!\"\\n\\n\\nThere was no answer.\\n\\n\\nThe door of the lighthouse was ajar. They pushed it open and walked into a\\nshuttered twilight. Through an archway on the further side of the room they\\ncould see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. Just\\nunder the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet.\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Savage!\"\\n\\n\\nSlowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned\\ntowards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south,\\nsouth-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly\\nback towards the left. South-south-west, south, south-east, east. …\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \\n\\n\\nHOME\\nIsland\\nHuxley Hotlinks\\nAldous Huxley Photogallery\\nCritique of Brave New World\\nWho\\'s Who in Brave New World\\nStudy Aid: Barron\\'s Notes on BNW\\nStudy Aid: Monarch\\'s Notes on BNW\\n\"Soma\" in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World\\nAldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World Revisited (1958)\\n\\n\\n\\nif(window.parent==window){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');ga(\\'create\\',\\'UA-38633269-24\\',\\'auto\\',{\\'siteSpeedSampleRate\\':100});ga(\\'send\\',\\'pageview\\');}\\n']"
